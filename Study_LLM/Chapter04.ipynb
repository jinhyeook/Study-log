G. H.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO INVEST MONEY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENT\\n\\n\\nWith the immense increase in wealth in the United States during the last\\ndecade and its more general distribution, the problem of investment has\\nassumed correspondingly greater importance. As long as the average\\nbusiness man was an habitual borrower of money and possest no private\\nfortune outside of his interest in his business, he was not greatly\\nconcerned with investment problems. The surplus wealth of the country\\nfor a long time was in the hands of financial institutions and a few\\nwealthy capitalists. These men, the officers and directors of banks,\\nsavings-banks, and insurance companies, and the possessors of hereditary\\nwealth, were thoroughly equipped by training and experience for the\\nsolving of investment problems and needed no help in the disposition of\\nthe funds under their control. During the last ten years, however, these\\nconditions have been greatly altered. The number of business men to-day\\nin possession of funds in excess of their private wants and business\\nrequirements is far greater than it was ten years ago, and is constantly\\nincreasing. These men are confronted with a real investment problem.\\n\\nWhile they have not always recognized it, the problem which they are\\ncalled upon to solve is really twofold--it concerns the safeguarding of\\ntheir private fortune and the wise disposition of their business\\nsurplus. They have usually seen the first part of this problem, but not\\nall have succeeded in clearly understanding the second. When the\\ntreatment of a man\\'s business surplus is spoken of as an investment\\nproblem, it is meant, of course, not his working capital, which should\\nbe kept in liquid form for immediate needs, but that portion of his\\nsurplus which is set aside for emergencies. It is coming to be a\\nrecognized principle that every business enterprise of whatever kind or\\nsize should establish a reserve fund. It is felt that the possession of\\na reserve fund puts the business upon a secure foundation, adds to its\\nfinancial strength and reputation, and greatly increases its credit and\\nborrowing capacity. The recognition of this fact, combined with the\\nability to set aside a reserve fund, has brought many men to a\\nconsideration of the best way in which to dispose of it. It is obviously\\na waste of income to have the surplus in bank-accounts; more than that,\\nthere would be a constant temptation to use it and to confuse it with\\nworking capital. Its best disposition is plainly in some safe\\ninterest-bearing security, which can be readily sold, so that it will be\\navailable for use if necessity demands.\\n\\nConfronted with the double problem thus outlined, what measure of\\nsuccess has attended the average business man in its solution?\\n\\nIt is safe to say that the average man has found it easier to make money\\nthan to take care of it. Money-making, for him, is the result of\\nsuccessful activity in his own line of business, with which he is\\nthoroughly familiar; while the investment of money is a thing apart from\\nhis business, with which he is not familiar, and of which he may have\\nhad little practical experience. His failure to invest money wisely is\\nnot due to any want of intelligence or of proper care and foresight on\\nhis part, as he sometimes seems to believe, but simply because he is\\nignorant of the principles of a business which differs radically from\\nhis own.\\n\\nThe investment of money is a banker\\'s business. When the average man has\\nfunds to invest, whether he be a business man or a pure investor, he\\nshould consult some experienced and reliable investment banker just as\\nhe would consult a doctor or a lawyer if he were in need of medical or\\nlegal advice. This book is not intended to take the place of\\nconsultation with a banker, but to supplement it.\\n\\nThe advantage of such consultation is shown by the fact that if a man\\nattempts to rely on his own judgment, he is almost certain not to do the\\nbest thing, even if his business instinct leads him to avoid those\\nenterprises which are more plainly unpromising or fraudulent. It should\\nbe remembered, however, that widows and orphans are not the only ones\\nensnared by attractive advertisements and the promise of brilliant\\nreturns. In most cases, widows\\' and orphans\\' funds are protected by\\nconscientious and conservative trustees, and it is the average business\\nman who furnishes the money which is ultimately lost in all propositions\\nwhich violate the fundamental laws of investment.\\n\\nThe average man is led into these unwise investments through a very\\nnatural error of judgment. Accustomed to take reasonable chances and to\\nmake large returns in his own business, he fails to detect anything\\nfundamentally wrong in a proposition simply because it promises to pay\\nwell. He forgets that the rate of interest on _invested money_, or pure\\ninterest, is very small, and that anything above that can only come as\\npayment for management, as he makes in his own business, or at the\\nsacrifice of some essential factor of safety which will usually lead to\\ndisaster.\\n\\nFor the successful investment of money, however, a good deal more is\\nrequired than the mere ability to select a safe security. That is only\\none phase of the problem. Scientific investment demands a clear\\nunderstanding of the fundamental distinctions between different classes\\nof securities and strict adherence to the two cardinal principles,\\ndistribution of risk and selection of securities in accordance with\\nreal requirements.\\n\\nOne of the most important distinctions is that between _promises to pay_\\nand _equities_. Bonds, real-estate mortgages, and loans on collateral\\nrepresent somebody\\'s promise to pay a certain sum of money at a future\\ndate; and if the promise be good and the security ample, the holder of\\nthe promise will be paid the money at the time due. On the other hand,\\n_equities_, such as the capital stocks of banking, railway, and\\nindustrial corporations, represent only a certain residuary share in the\\nassets and profits of a working concern, after payment of its\\nobligations and fixt charges. The value of this residuary share may be\\nlarge or small, may increase or diminish, but in no case can the holder\\nof such a share require any one, least of all the company itself, to\\nredeem the certificate representing his interest at the price he paid\\nfor it, nor indeed at any price. If a man buys a $1,000 railroad bond,\\nhe knows that the railroad, if solvent, will pay him $1,000 in cash when\\nthe bond is due. But if he buys a share of railroad stock, his only\\nchance of getting his money back, if he should wish it, is that some\\none else will want to buy his share for what he paid for it, or more. In\\none case he has bought a _promise to pay_, and in the other an _equity_.\\n\\nIt is not the intention, from the foregoing, to draw the conclusion that\\n_equities_ under no circumstances are to be regarded as investments,\\nbecause many of our bank and railroad stocks, and even some of our\\npublic-utility and industrial stocks, have attained a stability and\\npermanence of value and possess sufficiently long dividend records to\\njustify their consideration when investments are contemplated; but it is\\nessential that the investor should have a thorough understanding of the\\ndistinction involved.\\n\\nThe principle of distribution of risk is a simple one. It involves no\\nmore than obedience to the old rule which forbids putting all one\\'s eggs\\nin the same basket. The number of men who carry out this principle with\\nany thoroughness, however, is very small. Proper distribution means not\\nonly the division of property among the various forms of investment, as\\nrailroad bonds, municipals, mortgages, public-utility bonds, etc., but\\nalso the preservation of proper geographical proportions within each\\nform. Adherence to this principle is perhaps not so important for\\nprivate investors as for institutions. A striking instance of the need\\nfor insistence upon its observance in the institutional field was\\nfurnished by one of the fire-insurance companies of San Francisco after\\nthe earthquake. It appeared that the company\\'s assets were largely\\ninvested in San Francisco real estate and in local enterprises\\ngenerally, where the bulk of its fire risks were concentrated. As a\\nresult, the very catastrophe which converted its risks into actual\\nliabilities deprived its assets of all immediate value. This instance\\nserves to show the importance of the principle and the necessity for its\\nobservance.\\n\\nThe principle of selection in accordance with real requirements is more\\ncomplex. It involves a thorough understanding of the chief points which\\nmust be considered in the selection of all investments. These are five\\nin number: (1) _Safety of principal and interest_, or the assurance of\\nreceiving the principal and interest on the dates due; (2) _rate of\\nincome_, or the net return which is realized on the actual amount of\\nmoney invested; (3) _convertibility into cash_, or the readiness with\\nwhich it is possible to realize on the investment; (4) _prospect of\\nappreciation in value_, or that growth in intrinsic value which tends to\\nadvance market price; and (5) _stability of market price_, or the\\nlikelihood of maintaining the integrity of the principal invested.\\n\\nThe five qualities above enumerated are present in different degrees in\\nevery investment, and the scientific investor naturally selects those\\nsecurities which possess in a high degree the qualities upon which he\\nwishes to place emphasis. A large part of the problem of investment lies\\nin the careful selection of securities to meet one\\'s actual\\nrequirements. The average investor does not thoroughly understand this\\npoint. He does not realize that a high degree of one quality involves a\\nlower degree of other qualities. He may have a general impression that a\\nhigh rate of income is apt to indicate less assurance of safety, but he\\nrarely applies the same reasoning to other qualities. When he buys\\nsecurities, he is quite likely to pay for qualities which he does not\\nneed. It is very common, for example, when he wishes to make a permanent\\ninvestment and has no thought of reselling, to find him purchasing\\nsecurities which possess in a high degree the quality of convertibility.\\nFrom his point of view, this is pure waste. A high degree of\\nconvertibility is only obtained at the sacrifice of some other\\nquality--usually rate of income. If he were to use more care in his\\nselections, he could probably find some other security possessing equal\\nsafety, equal stability, and equal promise of appreciation in value,\\nwhich would yield considerably greater revenue, lacking only ready\\nconvertibility. Thus he would satisfy his real requirements and obtain a\\ngreater income, at the expense only of a quality which he does not need.\\n\\nThe quality of convertibility divides investors into classes more\\nsharply than any other quality. For some investors convertibility is a\\nmatter of small importance; for others it is the paramount\\nconsideration. Generally speaking, the private investor does not need to\\nplace much emphasis upon the quality of convertibility, at least for the\\nlarger part of his estate. On the other hand, for a business surplus,\\nready convertibility is an absolute necessity, and in order to secure\\nit, something in the way of income must usually be sacrificed.\\n\\nAgain, some investors are so situated that they can insist strongly upon\\npromise of appreciation in value, while others can not afford to do so.\\nRich men whose income is in excess of their wants, can afford to forego\\nsomething in the way of yearly return for the sake of a strong prospect\\nof appreciation in value. Such men naturally buy bank and trust-company\\nstocks, whose general characteristic is a small return upon the money\\ninvested, but a strong likelihood of appreciation in value. This is\\nowing to the general practise of well-regulated banks to distribute only\\nabout half their earnings in dividends and to credit the rest to\\nsurplus, thus insuring a steady rise in the book value of the stock.\\nRich men, again, can afford to take chances with the quality of safety,\\nfor the sake of greater income, in a way which poor men should never do.\\nIn practise, however, if the writer\\'s observation can be depended upon,\\nit is usually the poor men who take the chances--and lose their money.\\n\\nIn the quality of safety, there is a marked difference between safety of\\nprincipal and safety of interest. With some investments the principal is\\nmuch safer than the interest, and _vice versa_. This can best be\\nillustrated by examples. The bonds of terminal companies, which are\\nguaranteed as to interest, under the terms of a lease, by the railroads\\nwhich use the terminal, are usually far safer as to interest than as to\\nprincipal. While the lease lasts, the interest is probably perfectly\\nsecure, but when the lease expires and the bonds mature, the railroads\\nmay see fit to abandon the terminal and build one elsewhere, if the city\\nhas grown in another direction, and the terminal may cease to have any\\nvalue except as real estate. On the other hand, a new railroad, built in\\na thinly settled but rapidly growing part of the country, may have\\ndifficulty in bad years in meeting its interest charges, and may even go\\ninto temporary default, but if the bonds are issued at a low rate per\\nmile and the management of the road is honest and capable, the safety of\\nthe principal can scarcely be questioned.\\n\\nStability of market price is frequently a consideration of great\\nimportance. This quality should never be confused with the quality of\\nsafety. Safety means the assurance that the maker of the obligation will\\npay principal and interest when due; stability of market price means\\nthat the investment shall not shrink in quoted value. These are very\\ndifferent things, tho frequently identified in people\\'s minds. An\\ninvestment may possess assured safety of principal and interest and yet\\nsuffer a violent decline in quoted price, owing to a change in general\\nbusiness and financial conditions. In times of continued business\\nprosperity very high rates are demanded for the use of money, because\\nthe liquid capital of the country, to a large extent, has been converted\\ninto fixt forms, in the development of new mines, the building of new\\nfactories and railroads, and in the improvement and extension of\\nexisting properties. These high rates have the effect of reducing the\\nprice level of investment securities because people having such\\nsecurities are apt to sell them in order to lend the money so released,\\nthus maintaining the parity between the yields upon free and invested\\ncapital.\\n\\nAs an illustration of this tendency, within the last few years New York\\nCity 3-1/2-per-cent bonds have declined from 110 to 90, without the\\nslightest suspicion of their safety. Their inherent qualities have\\nchanged in no respect except that their prospect of appreciation in\\nquoted price has become decidedly brighter. Their fall in price has been\\ndue to two factors, one general and the other special--first, the\\nabsorption of liquid capital and consequent rise in interest rates,\\noccasioned by the unprecedented business activity of the country, and,\\nsecond, to the unfavorable technical position of the bonds, due to an\\nincreased supply in the face of a decreased demand.\\n\\nIt will be seen that the question of maintaining the integrity of the\\nmoney invested is a matter of great importance and deserves to rank as a\\nfifth factor in determining the selection of investments, altho it is\\nnot an inherent quality of each investment, but is dependent for its\\neffect upon general conditions. If it is essential to the investor that\\nhis security should not shrink in quoted price, his best investment is a\\nreal-estate mortgage, which is not quoted and consequently does not\\nfluctate. For the investment of a business surplus, however, where a\\nhigh degree of convertibility is required, real-estate mortgages will\\nnot answer, and the best way to guard against shrinkage is to purchase a\\nshort-term security, whose approach to maturity will maintain the price\\nclose to par.\\n\\nThe foregoing comments, in a brief and imperfect way, serve to indicate\\nthe main points which should be considered in the selection of\\nsecurities for investment. The considerations advanced will be amplified\\nas occasion demands in the following pages. For the present, the main\\nlesson which it is sought to draw is the necessity that a man should\\nhave a thorough understanding of his real requirements before he\\nattempts to make investments. For a private investor to go to a banker\\nand ask him to suggest a security to him without telling him the exact\\nnature of his wants is about as foolish as it would be for a patient to\\ngo to a physician and ask him to give him some medicine without telling\\nhim the symptoms of the trouble which he wished cured. In neither case\\ncan the adviser act intelligently unless he knows what end he is seeking\\nto accomplish.\\n\\nIt is plainly impossible within the limits of a small volume to consider\\nthe needs of all classes of investors. Special attention will be paid to\\nthe requirements of a business surplus and of the private investor. In\\nthe field of private investment two distinct classes can be\\nrecognized--those who are dependent upon income from investments and\\nthose who are not. Both classes will be considered. For the investment\\nof a business surplus, safety, convertibility, and stability of price\\nare the qualities to be emphasized; for investors dependent upon income,\\nsafety and a high return; and for those not dependent upon income, a\\nhigh return and prospect of appreciation in value. In the following\\nchapters railroad bonds, real-estate mortgages, industrial,\\npublic-utility, and municipal bonds and stocks will be considered in\\nturn; their advantages and disadvantages will be analyzed in accordance\\nwith the determining qualities above enumerated, and their adaptability\\nto the requirements of a business surplus and of private investment will\\nbe discust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nRAILROAD MORTGAGE BONDS\\n\\n\\nA railroad bond is an obligation of a railroad company (usually secured\\nby mortgage upon railroad property) which runs for a certain length of\\ntime at a certain rate of interest. It is apparent, from this\\ndefinition, that the price of a railroad bond, as distinct from its\\nvalue, is affected by two _accidental conditions_ quite apart from the\\nfive determining qualities described in the preceding chapter.\\n\\nThese accidental conditions are the length of time that the bond has to\\nrun and the rate of interest that it bears. To understand clearly the\\ninfluence of these accidental conditions is a matter of the utmost\\nimportance. It is evident, for instance, that a 5-per-cent fifty-year\\nbond, based on a given security, will sell at a widely different price\\nfrom a 3-1/2-per-cent twenty-year bond, based on the same security; yet\\nthe only difference is in the accidental conditions which are under the\\ncontrol of the board of directors.\\n\\nIn order to eliminate these accidental features from the situation, it\\nis customary for bond-dealers to classify bonds purely on the basis of\\ntheir yield, or net income return. As a thorough understanding of this\\npoint is essential to an accurate judgment of bond values, whether\\nrailroad bonds or otherwise, it must be developed in detail, even at the\\nrisk of carrying the reader over familiar ground.\\n\\nIf a bond sells above par, it does not yield its purchaser a net return\\nas great as the rate of interest which the bond bears, for two reasons:\\nfirst, because the loss in principal, represented by the premium which\\nthe purchaser pays, must be distributed over the number of years which\\nthe bond has to run, and operates to reduce the rate of interest which\\nthe holder receives; and, secondly, because the rate is paid only on the\\npar value of the bond instead of on the actual money invested. Thus, if\\na 6-percent bond with eight years to run sells at 110-3/4, it will yield\\nonly 4.40 per cent, which means that if the holder spends more than\\n$48.73 (4.40 per cent of $1,107.50) out of the $60 which he receives\\nannually, he is spending the excess out of principal, and not out of\\nincome. Conversely, if a bond sells below par, it yields more than the\\nrate of interest which the bond bears.\\n\\nThese yields have been calculated with the utmost exactness for all\\nbonds paying from 2 per cent to 7 per cent and running from six months\\nto one hundred years, so that it is only necessary to turn to the tables\\nto discover what will be the net return upon a given bond at a given\\nprice. This net return is generally known as the \"basis,\" and bonds are\\nspoken of as selling upon a 3.80 per cent basis or a 4.65 per cent basis\\nor whatever the figure may be, with no reference whatever to the price\\nor to the rate of interest which the bond bears. Indeed, so exclusively\\nis the basis considered by bond-dealers that very often bonds are bought\\nand sold upon a basis price, and the actual figures at which the bonds\\nchange hands are not determined until after the transaction is\\nconcluded.\\n\\nIt is not expected, of course, that the average business man will\\npurchase bonds in quite as scientific a way as this, but it is essential\\nthat he should understand that while the intrinsic value of a bond is\\ndetermined only by the five general factors described, its money value,\\nor price, is affected also by these two accidental conditions. Exprest\\nin other words, he must realize that the general factor described as\\n_rate of income_ does not mean the coupon rate of interest which the\\nbond bears, but the scientific \"basis,\" derived by elimination of the\\naccidental features.\\n\\nWithin the past year there has been a good deal of uninformed comment\\nabout the safety of railroad bonds. Before the era of popular agitation\\nand governmental antagonism, railroad bonds enjoyed a large measure of\\npublic confidence; but it can not be denied that some part of this\\nconfidence has been shaken as a result of the recent exposures. Even\\nclearheaded men have exaggerated the importance of the developments; and\\ntoo often railroad officials, who should have insisted upon the\\nsoundness and stability of their properties, when they elected to talk\\nfor publication, have given way instead to dismal and unwarranted\\nforebodings.\\n\\nThere is no mystery involved in determining the safety of railroad\\nbonds. Any man of business experience, keeping in mind the general\\nprinciple which measures the value of all obligations, can easily\\ndetermine, with the aid of two documents, the degree of safety which\\nattaches to any particular railroad bond. The general principle to be\\nobserved is that the safety of any obligation depends upon the margin of\\nsecurity in excess of the amount of the loan; and the two documents to\\nbe consulted are the mortgage or trust indenture securing the bonds,\\nwhich describes the property mortgaged, and the last annual report of\\nthe railroad, which shows its financial condition.\\n\\nConfining the analysis, for the present, to mortgage bonds upon the\\ngeneral mileage of a railroad, the following points should be\\nconsidered:\\n\\n(1) _Rate per mile at which the bond is issued._ Applying the general\\nprinciple indicated above, it must be learned what proportion the bonded\\ndebt of a railroad bears to the total market value of the property. It\\nis much easier to make this comparison on a per-mile basis. In\\ndetermining whether the rate per mile is excessive, reference must be\\nmade not so much to the particular bond in question as to the total\\nbonded debt per mile of the railroad, and to the relation which that\\nfigure bears to the total market value of the property per mile. The\\ntotal market value per mile is obtained by adding the market value of\\nthe stock per mile to the par value of the bonded debt per mile. A\\nsingle issue of bonds varies all the way from $5,000 to $100,000 per\\nmile, according to the location of the railroad. Total capitalization\\nper mile--stocks and bonds at par--varies in about the same proportion,\\nfrom $35,000 to $300,000. The average for all the railroads of the\\nUnited States is $67,936 per mile. The actual cost of the railroad, as\\nshown by the balance-sheet, must be taken into consideration, and also\\nthe estimated cost of duplicating the property. Physical difficulties of\\nconstruction must be weighed, for a railroad through a flat, sandy\\ncountry should not be bonded for as much, other things being equal, as a\\nrailroad through a mountainous country, where much cutting, filling, and\\nbridging are required. The section of country in which the railroad is\\nlocated must be considered, for $35,000 per mile on a single-track line\\nin a poor country may be higher than $300,000 per mile on a four-track\\ntrunk line which owns valuable terminals and rights of way through\\nseveral large cities.\\n\\n(2) _Amount of prior lien bonds outstanding per mile._ The amount of\\nbonds which come ahead of the bond in question on the same mileage is a\\nmatter of great importance and works directly against the security of\\nthe bond. Purchasing a bond which is preceded by a prior line bond is\\nlike taking a real-estate mortgage on property already encumbered. If\\nthe bond is not followed by other bonds, then the margin of security in\\nthe property is represented wholly by the market value of the stock per\\nmile, and the investor must figure carefully the value of this equity.\\n\\n(3) _Amount of junior lien bonds outstanding per mile._ The amount of\\nbonds which come after the bond in question, on the other hand, works\\ndirectly in favor of the bond, for it increases the margin of security.\\nIt shows also that other people have had sufficient confidence in the\\nproperty to invest their money in obligations subject to the one in\\nquestion. In the event of a receivership this is often a matter of great\\nimportance; for if a foreclosure sale is ordered the junior bondholders,\\nin order to protect their own interest, must buy in the property for an\\namount at least equal to the par value of the prior lien bonds.\\n\\nThe foregoing considerations apply particularly to the safety of the\\nprincipal invested in railroad bonds; the following points affect the\\nsafety of interest:\\n\\n(4) _Gross earnings per mile._ The gross earnings of a railroad must be\\ncompared with those of other roads occupying the same field, and the\\nreturns for a number of years must be examined to determine whether such\\nearnings have increased or decreased. The position in which the railroad\\nstands for obtaining new traffic must be noted. This is dependent\\nsomewhat upon the railroad\\'s ability to take traffic from other\\nrailroads, but more upon the probable growth and development of the\\nterritory which the railroad serves, and the increased traffic which\\nwill probably be offered. In this connection the rate of increase in\\npopulation in the road\\'s territory is important. The proportion between\\npassenger and freight earnings, the diversity and density of freight\\ntraffic, and passenger and freight rates should be examined. The\\nreputation of the management for ability and integrity should be\\nconsidered. Gross earnings run from about $3,000 to $40,000 per mile\\nwith the average $10,460.\\n\\n(5) _Net income per mile._ Net income is obtained by subtracting from\\ngross earnings operating expenses (and sometimes taxes) and adding to\\nthe net earnings so obtained whatever income from other sources the\\nrailroad may derive. This is a very important figure. As with gross\\nearnings, the reports should be examined to determine whether net income\\nis on the increase or the decrease, and it should be compared with the\\nnet income of other railroads occupying the same field. It involves a\\ncriticism of operating expenses. The payments of the railroad must be\\nanalyzed to determine whether the proper sums have been expended for\\nmaintenance of way, replenishment of rolling stock, and other\\nimprovements sufficient to keep the road in good physical condition.\\nNormally speaking, operating expenses should absorb about 65 per cent of\\ngross earnings. If it is found that a railroad operates for 60 per cent,\\nhowever, it does not always follow that its operating officials are\\nexceptionally efficient, so that the cost of conducting transportation\\nis relatively small; it may mean that the physical condition of the\\nproperty is being neglected, or that ordinary improvements, which should\\nbe charged to maintenance, are being paid for by increase in\\ncapitalization. It is very important for the investor to find out which\\nis the case. If analysis leads to the suspicion that the earnings result\\nfrom neglecting the property or capitalizing every trivial improvement,\\nthe railroad\\'s bonds should be rejected. Net income varies from $1,500\\nto $12,000 per mile, with an average of $4,702.\\n\\n(6) _Fixt charges per mile._ The fixt charges of a railroad include\\ninterest on its bonds, rentals, and taxes (when the last-named are not\\nreported with operating expenses). The importance of this figure lies in\\nits relation to net income. If a railroad does not earn well over double\\nits fixt charges, its obligations can not be regarded as in the first\\ninvestment rank. Of course, when a railroad earns more than twice the\\ninterest requirement upon its entire bonded debt, it is probable that\\nsome of the underlying bonds are protected by three, four, or five times\\nthe interest requirement upon them, and their position is\\ncorrespondingly strengthened.\\n\\nThe foregoing analysis applies particularly to mortgage bonds upon the\\ngeneral mileage of a railroad and not to such special issues as\\ncollateral trust, terminal, bridge, or guaranteed bonds. It will not be\\nnecessary, however, to lay down any rules as to these classes of bonds,\\nfor the general principles outlined above, with slight modifications of\\ndetail, will be found equally applicable to a judgment of their value.\\nEquipment bonds, on the other hand, owing to their want of similarity to\\nany other railroad issues, will receive separate treatment later.\\n\\nIt is of interest, in view of the present diminished confidence in\\nrailroad securities, to advance certain considerations touching upon the\\nsafety of railroad bonds in general.\\n\\nThe last published report of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, year\\n1906, furnishes interesting testimony on this subject. A table on page\\n60 shows that the total railroad capital of the United States for that\\nyear was $14,570,421,478, of which $7,766,661,385, or 53.31 per cent,\\nwas in the form of bonded debt, and the rest in capital stock.\\n\\nThese figures indicate a substantial equity, but are somewhat misleading\\nbecause they refer to par value. A fair estimate of the market value of\\nthis stock equity, which is the margin of security in the properties\\nfrom the bondholder\\'s point of view, can be obtained from a table on\\npage 82, which shows a balance available for dividends, after paying all\\noperating expenses and fixt charges, of all the railroads of the United\\nStates for the year ended June 30, 1906, of $457,060,326. This amount is\\nequivalent to nearly 7 per cent upon the total par value of the stocks.\\n\\nEstimating that a railroad stock should earn 10 per cent upon its market\\nprice--and even the most prejudiced will admit that a stock earning 10\\nper cent is worth par--the total market value of American railroad\\nstocks would be $4,570,603,260, or more than half the par value of the\\nbonds. In other words, the bonded debt would represent something less\\nthan 63 per cent of the total market value of the property. This\\ncompares favorably with the security of first mortgages upon real\\nestate.\\n\\nWhen the safety of interest is considered, the showing made is equally\\nstrong. Page 82 of the report above quoted shows that the net income of\\nthe railroads of the United States for the year ended June 30, 1906,\\nafter payment of all operating expenses, was $848,836,771, and the total\\nfixt charges, including interest on bonds, interest on current\\nliabilities, and taxes, amounted to $391,776,445, leaving a balance\\navailable for dividends of $457,060,326. It is apparent, therefore, that\\nthe net earnings of the railroads of the United States, considered as\\none system, could be cut in half without affecting the payment of\\ninterest upon the railroad\\'s obligations. This affords a large measure\\nof protection.\\n\\nThe following analysis shows that the actual market value of the\\nrailroads is probably greater than the estimate made above.\\n\\n     The table shows the percentage of bonded debt to total market\\n     value of some of the more important railroad systems. Two trunk\\n     lines in the East, a north and south line in the middle West,\\n     and two transcontinental have been chosen. No attempt has been\\n     made to select railroads which would make a favorable showing.\\n     Indeed Pennsylvania, and Union Pacific, by reason of their\\n     recent heavy bond issues, probably compare unfavorably with\\n     others which might have been chosen. The figures showing the\\n     par value of bonds outstanding have been taken from last annual\\n     reports, with additions made for recent issues. The figures\\n     showing the market value of stocks are based on the amounts\\n     outstanding April 1st, 1908, at the market price.\\n\\n                        Par value of    Approx. market   Per cent\\n                     bonds outstanding value of stock   of bonds\\n                                          outstanding    to total\\n                                                          value\\n\\n    Pennsylvania        $270,974,645     $361,000,000      42.8\\n    New York Central     255,414,845      174,000,000      59.4\\n    Illinois Central     156,053,275      120,000,000      56.6\\n    Great Northern       207,517,939      260,000,000      44.3\\n    Union Pacific        274,827,000      324,000,000      45.9\\n\\nIn view of the enormous decline which has occurred in railroad stocks\\nduring the past eighteen months, the showing above is truly remarkable.\\nIt is plain that the entire bonded debt of any of these standard\\nrailroads is less than 60 per cent of the total market value of the\\nproperty, while in the cases of the Pennsylvania, Great Northern, and\\nUnion Pacific, _more than half of the present market value of the\\nproperty could be erased before the lien of the bonds least well secured\\nwould be impaired_.\\n\\nOf course, where the entire bonded debt is protected by such a margin,\\nit is evident that the underlying bonds (the prior liens and first\\nmortgages) are protected by several times as great a margin and their\\nposition is correspondingly strengthened.\\n\\nThe foregoing analysis, in the judgment of the writer, affords\\nconvincing proof not only that the prevailing want of confidence in\\nrailroad obligations is without foundation, but that railroad bonds\\ncompare favorably in point of safety with any other form of investment.\\n\\nIt remains to point out the amount of income and degree of\\nconvertibility which they afford and the extent of appreciation in value\\nwhich they promise. It is impossible to do more than indicate the\\ngeneral characteristics of railroad bonds in these particulars.\\n\\nRailroad bonds cover a wide range of income return. They yield all the\\nway from 3-3/4 per cent to 9 per cent, the general average being from 4\\nper cent to 6 per cent. As a class they yield more than government or\\nmunicipal bonds, and less than public-utility or industrial bonds. With\\nequal security they probably yield less than real-estate mortgages.\\nCompared with stocks they return more than bank stocks, average about\\nthe same as railroad stocks, and yield less than public-utility,\\nindustrial, or mining stocks. These comparisons are intended to apply to\\nthe classes as a whole, and remain generally true in spite of specific\\ncases to the contrary.\\n\\nConvertibility is the distinguishing mark of railroad bonds. Generally\\nspeaking they may be more easily marketed than any other class of bonds.\\nCompared with stocks they exceed public-utility, mining, and bank stocks\\nin point of convertibility, and yield only to railroad stocks. It is\\nhard to say whether or not they possess greater convertibility than\\nindustrial stocks, but it is probable that they do, allowing for the\\nfact that an undue impression is created by the activity of certain\\nprominent shares.\\n\\nRailroad bonds as a class possess great promise of appreciation in\\nvalue. American railroads, generally speaking, have adopted the\\nconservative policy of putting a considerable part of their annual\\nearnings back into the property in the form of improvements. To the\\nextent to which this policy is followed, an equity is created back of\\nthe bonds which raises their intrinsic value. This policy contrasts\\nfavorably with the general practise of English roads to pay out all\\ntheir earnings in dividends, and to capitalize their improvements. In\\naddition, new capital for American railroads is largely raised by stock\\nissues, which further increases the margin of security for the\\nbondholders. Taken together these facts insure a steady enhancement in\\nthe intrinsic value of railroad bonds, which is bound to be reflected,\\nother things being equal, in higher prices.\\n\\nWe shall not attempt to discuss at this time the degree of stability of\\nmarket price which railroad bonds enjoy. As explained in the first\\nchapter, stability of market price is dependent upon general financial\\nand business conditions. It is sufficient to point out here that the\\nmaintenance intact of the principal sum invested can only be rendered\\ncertain by the purchase of short-time securities whose near approach to\\nmaturity will keep their price close to par. In a later chapter the\\ngeneral principles which determine this question will be elucidated.\\n\\nThe ideal investment may be defined as one combining ample security of\\nprincipal and interest, a good rate of income, ready convertibility into\\ncash, and reasonable promise of appreciation in value. Measured by the\\nrequirements of this definition, the conclusion seems justified that\\nwell-selected railroad bonds, if purchased under favorable money-market\\nconditions, afford a highly desirable form of investment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nRAILROAD EQUIPMENT BONDS\\n\\n\\nAs its name implies, an equipment bond is one issued by a railroad to\\nprovide funds with which to pay for new rolling stock--cars and\\nlocomotives. The issues are variously described as car trust\\ncertificates, equipment bonds, or equipment notes. They conform in\\ngeneral to one of two standard forms: (1) The conditional sale plan: In\\naccordance with specifications furnished by the railroad, the trustee\\nselected (usually a trust company) contracts with the builders for the\\npurchase of the equipment. From 10 to 20 per cent of the cost of the\\nequipment is paid in cash by the railroad and the rest is represented by\\nthe equipment bonds. The bonds are the direct obligation of the railroad\\ncompany. They are secured by a first lien upon the entire equipment\\npurchased. The title to the equipment remains in the trustee for the\\nbenefit of the bondholders until the last bond has been paid, so that\\nunder no circumstances can the general mortgages of the railroad attach\\nas a first lien on the equipment ahead of the car trust obligations.\\nAfter the final payment, the trustee assigns title to the railroad\\ncompany, which thereupon becomes the owner in fee of the equipment.\\nUnder the terms of the deed of trust the railroad is always obliged to\\nkeep the equipment fully insured, in good order and complete repair, and\\nto replace any equipment which may become worn out, lost, or destroyed.\\nThe bonds are usually issued in coupon form, $1,000 each, bearing\\nsemiannual interest, with provision for registration. They are generally\\npaid off in semiannual or annual instalments of substantially equal\\namounts, the last instalment usually falling due in ten years, a period\\nwell within the life of the equipment as estimated under the master car\\nbuilder\\'s rules. Occasionally this method of payment is altered by the\\nsubstitution of a sinking fund, the bonds having a uniform fixt\\nmaturity, but subject to the operation of a sinking fund which is\\nsufficient to retire the entire issue well within the life of the\\nequipment. In either case the security, ample at the outset, increases\\nproportionally with the reduction in obligations outstanding against\\nit.\\n\\n(2) The so-called \"Philadelphia plan.\" Under this plan the equipment is\\npurchased by an individual, association, or corporation which leases the\\nequipment to the railroad for a term of years at a rental equivalent to\\nthe interest and maturing instalments of the bonds. The contract of\\nlease is then assigned to a trust company as trustee, which thereupon\\nissues its certificates in substantially the form described in the plan\\nabove, these representing a beneficial interest in the equipment, which\\nare usually guaranteed both principal and interest by the railroad. The\\nlease runs until the last bond has been paid, after which the trustee\\nassigns title to the railroad as above. The chief advantage of this plan\\nover the other is that in some States, notably Pennsylvania,\\ncertificates issued in accordance with its terms are exempt from\\ntaxation, whereas under the conditional sale plan, as the direct\\nobligation of the railroad, the bonds would be taxable.\\n\\nIt is evident from the foregoing description that equipment bonds differ\\nin two important respects from all other classes of railroad issues.\\nFirst, the title to the property which secures the bonds does not vest\\nin the railroad; and, secondly, the property is movable and not fixt in\\nany one locality.\\n\\nBy virtue of these two points, the holders of equipment bonds possess a\\ngreat advantage over the holders of mortgage bonds in the event of a\\nrailroad\\'s becoming bankrupt.\\n\\nIf a railroad is unable to meet its interest charges, the mortgage\\nbondholders can rarely do better than have a receiver appointed who will\\noperate the railroad in their interest; but if, with honest and\\nefficient management, the railroad can not be made to earn its interest\\ncharges, the mortgage bondholders usually have to consent to the scaling\\nof their bonds to a point where the railroad can operate upon a paying\\nbasis.\\n\\nWith the holders of equipment bonds the case is quite different. If the\\nreceiver defaults upon their bonds they have only to direct the trustee\\nto enter upon possession of the equipment and sell it or lease it to\\nsome other railroad. The knowledge that they possess this power renders\\nits exercise generally unnecessary. The equipment of a railroad is\\nessential to its operation. It is the tool with which the railroad\\nhandles its business. If the receiver were deprived of the equipment it\\nwould be impossible for him to operate the road, and so he could never\\nsatisfy its creditors. Consequently the courts, both State and Federal,\\nhave ruled that the necessary equipment of a bankrupt railroad must be\\npreserved, and have placed the charges for principal and interest of\\nequipment obligations upon an equality with charges for wages,\\nmaterials, and other operating expenses, and in priority to interest of\\neven first-mortgage bonds.\\n\\nThese points sufficiently explain the remarkable record which equipment\\nbonds have made during reorganizations. Careful investigation has been\\nmade of the various railroads which were reorganized, either with or\\nwithout foreclosure, between the years 1888 and 1905. This covers the\\nchief period of railroad receivership. It was discovered that sixteen\\ndifferent railroads, aggregating nearly one hundred thousand miles and\\nlocated in widely different parts of the country, had outstanding\\nequipment bonds at the time of default. In every case the principal and\\ninterest of equipment bonds were paid in full, while all other\\nsecurities, with a few exceptions, were reduced in rate or amount or\\nboth. Two of these railroads offered to the holders of equipment bonds\\nthe option of an advantageous exchange of securities, which amounted to\\nmore than payment in full.\\n\\nThe foregoing facts justify the conclusion that equipment bonds possess\\nsecurity equal or superior to that of any other form of railroad bonds.\\n\\nLet us now consider their remaining characteristics--their rate of\\nincome, convertibility, prospect of appreciation in value, and stability\\nof market price.\\n\\nOne of the strongest features of equipment bonds is the relatively high\\nrate of income which they yield. The amount realized varies in\\naccordance with the financial strength and credit of the issuing\\nrailroad, and the margin of security in the equipment itself. As a\\ngeneral rule, the net return on the equipment bonds of a given railroad\\nis usually from 1/2 per cent to 3/4 per cent greater than on the\\nfirst-mortgage bonds of the same railroad. This is owing to the fact\\nthat while banks and scientific investors have bought equipment bonds\\nfor many years, the general public is not sufficiently familiar with the\\ninherent strength of these issues to create much of a demand for them.\\nThis insures a good return.\\n\\nEquipment bonds vary in point of convertibility. The reader will\\nremember from the description above that equipment bonds are usually\\nissued in serial form, with instalments maturing semiannually from six\\nmonths to ten years. By confining purchases to the shorter maturities,\\nsay within two or three years, a high degree of convertibility may\\nusually be obtained because the short maturities are greatly sought by\\nbanks and other financial institutions which regard equipment bonds in\\nmuch the same light as merchant\\'s paper or time loans secured by\\ncollateral. At a price equivalent to the rate which the best commercial\\npaper commands, there is always a good demand from the banks. Many banks\\nprefer equipment bonds to loans or paper on account of their greater\\nconvertibility. As the length of maturity increases, the degree of\\nconvertibility generally decreases, because the chief demand for the\\nlonger dates comes from insurance companies, which do not, in the\\naggregate, constitute as great a demand as the banks. When the demand\\nfrom private investors increases, as it undoubtedly will when they\\nbecome more familiar with the desirable points of these issues, all\\nmaturities will probably possess ready convertibility.\\n\\nIn the same way, equipment bonds vary as to stability of market price.\\nCompared with other classes of railroad issues, equipment bonds are all\\nrelatively stable, but the stability is especially marked in the shorter\\nmaturities.\\n\\nEquipment bonds possess little prospect of appreciation in value.\\n\\nThe attentive reader who has carefully followed the foregoing\\ndescription of equipment bonds, may have noticed a special adaptability\\non their part to the requirements of a business surplus. Broadly\\nspeaking, for such investment, a security is required which will combine\\nperfect safety of principal and interest, a good rate of income, ready\\nconvertibility into cash, and unyielding stability of market price. The\\nnecessity for insistence upon these requirements in the investment of a\\nbusiness surplus will appear upon a moment\\'s reflection. Safety is\\nrequired in all forms of investment, but is particularly important in\\nthe handling of business funds; a good rate of income is always\\ndesirable; convertibility is necessary for a business surplus so that\\nthe reserve funds may be converted into cash at any time; and it is of\\nthe utmost importance that the security should not shrink materially in\\nquoted price, no matter what changes may take place in financial and\\nbusiness conditions, so that if the need should arise for realizing on\\nthe reserve fund, it would be found unimpaired in amount. As explained\\nin a former chapter, this point can not be covered by the selection of\\nsecurities perfectly safe as to principal and interest, but only by the\\npurchase of short-term obligations.\\n\\nThe point may be illustrated as follows: Let it be supposed that a firm\\nor company has decided to invest $100,000 in the 5-per-cent equipment\\nbonds of a good railroad maturing in three years, which can be obtained\\nat par, merchant\\'s paper then commanding about 5-1/2 per cent. After two\\nyears it becomes necessary for the firm to realize on its investment at\\na time when commercial paper is floated with difficulty on a\\n6-1/2-per-cent or 7-per-cent basis. Under such money conditions the\\nequipment bonds could be sold on about a 6-per-cent basis, which would\\nmean a price of 99 for a 5-per-cent bond with one year to run. The firm,\\nin liquidating its investment, would therefore lose 1 per cent in\\nprincipal, but would have received 5 per cent interest for two years,\\nmaking the net return 4-1/2 per cent. Compare this showing with the\\nresult if the bonds when originally bought had had ten years to run\\ninstead of three.\\n\\nAfter two years, when the firm wished to dispose of its bonds it might\\nexperience some difficulty in doing so in the stringent money market\\nwhich has been supposed, but even if it succeeded in selling them upon a\\n6-per-cent basis, that would mean a price of only 93-3/4 and would\\nrepresent 6-1/4-per-cent loss in principal. If it were necessary to sell\\nthe bonds upon a higher basis or if the firm had purchased a bond with\\nmore than ten years to run, the relative disadvantage of the longer bond\\nwould be still more apparent. These points sufficiently demonstrate the\\nimportance of buying only short-term securities for the investment of a\\nbusiness surplus. Of course, if money conditions improve instead of\\nbecoming worse between the dates of purchase and sale, then a greater\\nprofit would be made with the longer-term bond. This, however, should\\nnot be allowed to influence the choice, first because it is not the\\nobject of a reserve fund to make a speculative profit, and secondly\\nbecause a firm or corporation is only likely to want to realize upon its\\nreserve fund when money is hard to obtain otherwise, and that is\\nprecisely the time when any long-term bond would be apt to show\\nconsiderable depreciation.\\n\\nThe foregoing considerations indicate a special adaptability on the part\\nof equipment bonds to the usual requirements of a business surplus. The\\npoints have been brought out at some length because of the importance of\\nthe subject to the average business man. The purpose in concentrating\\nattention upon a single instance has been to illustrate more clearly the\\nprinciples involved and at the same time to acquaint the business man\\nwith details of a highly desirable and somewhat unfamiliar form of\\nsecurity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nREAL-ESTATE MORTGAGES\\n\\n\\nIn the preceding chapter the discussion of railroad bonds was brought to\\na close. Before passing to the consideration of real-estate mortgages,\\nwhich is the next form of investment to be taken up, it may be well to\\nreview briefly the general principles advanced in the first chapter of\\nthis book, in order that the reader may have clearly in mind the main\\npoints upon which judgment of the value of investments should be based.\\n\\nThere are five chief points to be considered in the selection of all\\nforms of investment. These are: (1) safety of principal and interest;\\n(2) rate of income; (3) convertibility into cash; (4) prospect of\\nappreciation in intrinsic value; (5) stability of market price.\\n\\nKeeping these five general factors in mind, the present chapter will\\ndiscuss real-estate mortgages as a form of investment, both as adapted\\nto the requirements of private funds and of a business surplus.\\n\\nThe average American business man is so familiar with real-estate\\nmortgages that the details may be passed over briefly. A real-estate\\nmortgage, or a bond and mortgage, as it is sometimes called, consists\\nessentially of two parts, a bond or promise to pay a certain sum of\\nmoney at a future date with interest at a certain rate per annum, and a\\nmortgage or trust deed transferring title and ownership in a piece of\\nreal estate, with the provision that the transfer shall be void if the\\ninterest is regularly paid and the bond redeemed at maturity. Before\\nadvancing money on the security of a mortgage it is necessary to\\ndetermine whether the title to the property legally vests in the maker\\nof the mortgage; and during the continuance of the mortgage it is\\nnecessary to have proof that the taxes and assessments are being\\nregularly paid, and, in the case of improved property, the\\nfire-insurance as well.\\n\\nThe safety of real-estate mortgages, in common with the safety of all\\nobligations, depends upon the margin of security in excess of the amount\\nof the loan. In the case of real-estate mortgages the amount of this\\nmargin may be determined without great difficulty. It is only necessary\\nto have the property carefully appraised by an expert in real-estate\\nvalues. It does not follow, however, because a mortgage has been shown\\nto possess substantial equity, that it is perfectly safe as an\\ninvestment, unless it satisfies also another condition of great\\nimportance. A mortgage may not exceed 50 per cent of the selling value\\nof the real estate pledged, and yet be a poor investment. This point\\ninvolves a serious objection to real-estate mortgages which sometimes\\nescapes notice.\\n\\nThe holder of a mortgage is at a great disadvantage in regard to the\\nchanging value of real estate. If the value of the property upon which\\nhe holds a mortgage increases, the additional value enhances the\\nsecurity of the loan, but does not add to the principal which he has\\ninvested, while if the value of the property diminishes, not only is the\\nsecurity proportionately lessened, but if the impairment be great, the\\nholder is frequently compelled to take over the property and may suffer\\nloss of principal. In other words, he receives no direct benefit from an\\nincrease in the value of the property, but has to stand the larger part\\nof the risk of a decline in its value.\\n\\nThis is not the case with investments represented by negotiable\\nsecurities subject to changing market quotations. All such securities,\\nrailroad bonds for example, are acted on equally by changes in the value\\nof the property which secures them. Except for the influences of\\nmoney-market conditions, railroad bonds advance with an increase in the\\nvalue of the property and decline with a decrease in its value.\\nWell-selected bonds usually increase in value with time, and all such\\nincrease goes directly to the benefit of the holder. The failure of\\nreal-estate mortgages to respond similarly to changes in the value of\\nproperty places the holder of a mortgage at a great disadvantage.\\n\\nOwing to this characteristic, real-estate mortgages should be purchased\\nonly when general conditions in the real-estate market are distinctly\\nfavorable. Not only should the purchaser of a mortgage have sufficient\\nmargin of security in the particular piece of property upon which he is\\nloaning money, but he should also be satisfied that general real-estate\\nvalues are relatively low, that there has been no undue speculation, and\\nthat conditions favor an advance rather than a decline in real-estate\\nprices.\\n\\nNo class of property is subject to more rapid changes in value than real\\nestate. After an extensive advance the holder of a mortgage may be\\ninsufficiently protected by the equity in the property, even if his\\nmortgage represents only 60 per cent of the current appraised value of\\nthe real estate pledged. It may be that the 60 per cent which he has\\nloaned represents the total value or more than the total value a few\\nyears before. When a rapid advance in values occurs, tho it may be\\nlargely justified by the growth and development of the territory, there\\nis sure to be present an element of speculation which is likely to carry\\nprices beyond the point of reason. When the turn comes and a severe\\ncollapse takes place, its effects are extremely disastrous, because,\\nunlike speculation in stocks or commodities, no short selling exists in\\nreal estate to temper the fall, and the immobile form of capital makes\\nliquidation impossible. These considerations serve to show the need for\\ngreat prudence in the purchase of real-estate mortgages. If the investor\\nexercises due care in these particulars, he is reasonably sure of\\nobtaining a very high-grade security; if he neglects these precautions,\\nhe may suffer severe loss of principal.\\n\\nNo general figures are available which would indicate the degree of\\ncertainty attaching to the payment of interest upon real-estate\\nmortgages. Certain classes of mortgages, such as those secured by\\nunimproved real estate or dwellings, afford no direct security of\\ninterest payment other than the threat of foreclosure. Other classes,\\nsuch as mortgages upon stores, hotels, or office-buildings, are often\\nprotected by a large income from the direct operation of the mortgaged\\npremises, thus furnishing a security for the annual interest payment.\\nThe margin of protection in these cases varies greatly, so that no\\ngeneral conclusion can be drawn.\\n\\nThe other characteristics of real-estate mortgages may be passed over\\nmore briefly. It is generally conceded that mortgages return a higher\\nrate of income than can be obtained upon any other form of investment\\nwhich affords equal security. This constitutes their chief advantage.\\n\\nTheir chief disadvantage, on the other hand, lies in their entire want\\nof convertibility. There is no market for real-estate mortgages, and\\nexcept in special instances they can not be readily sold. The fact that\\nthey are not subject to quotation prevents them also from holding out\\nany prospect of appreciation in value. Their very deficiency in this\\nrespect, however, constitutes an important advantage from another point\\nof view. Since they are not quoted they can not shrink in market price\\nin obedience to changes in financial and business conditions. The buyer\\nof a mortgage is assured that he can carry his mortgage at par through\\nperiods when it may be necessary to mark down all negotiable securities\\nsubject to changing market quotations. This is frequently a matter of\\ngreat importance.\\n\\nThe general characteristics of real-estate mortgages may be summarized\\nas follows: (1) When carefully selected and purchased under favorable\\nconditions, great safety of principal and interest; (2) a relatively\\nhigh return; (3) a low degree of convertibility; (4) no prospect of\\nappreciation in value; and (5) the practical certainty of maintaining\\nthe integrity of the principal invested.\\n\\nIs a security possessing these characteristics a suitable investment for\\na business surplus? Only to a limited extent. The safety, high return,\\nand assurance against loss in quoted value of principal are all highly\\ndesirable qualities for this purpose, but the lack of convertibility is\\na fatal defect. No consideration is of greater importance in the\\ninvestment of a business surplus than a high degree of convertibility,\\nso that if the need should arise the investment may be instantly\\nliquidated. The fact that real-estate mortgages can not be readily\\ndisposed of makes it practically impossible to employ them for the\\ninvestment of a business surplus.\\n\\nWhere convertibility is not an essential requirement, and where the want\\nof promise of appreciation in value is not a serious matter, mortgages\\nafford a very desirable form of investment. The characteristics which\\nthey possess in an eminent degree--safety, high return, and assurance\\nagainst loss in quoted value of principal--are exactly suited to the\\nordinary requirements of savings-banks. Generally speaking, only a small\\nproportion of a savings-bank\\'s assets need be kept in liquid form or\\nreadily convertible, and accordingly they find mortgages highly\\ndesirable.\\n\\nFor the purpose of private investment the attractiveness of mortgages is\\nnot so easy to determine. Ordinarily, fluctations in quoted values are\\nof no great importance to the private investor, so that the absence of\\nquotation which mortgages enjoy is not especially valuable. Their safety\\nand high return are attractive qualities, but their want of\\nconvertibility and of prospect of appreciation in value are drawbacks.\\nOn the whole, the private investor may probably employ with advantage a\\ncertain part, but not too much of his estate in mortgage investments.\\n\\nAs part of a scientific and comprehensive scheme of investment, the\\nspecial advantages of real-estate mortgages appear most prominently in\\nthe years following a business depression. During such a period\\nreal-estate values are usually relatively low, but beginning to advance,\\nso that mortgages present their maximum margin of security. At such a\\ntime they compare most favorably with bonds and other investment\\nsecurities which are subject to changing quotations, because such\\nsecurities are then apt to be at their highest point under the combined\\ninfluence of restored confidence and the low money rates which usually\\nprevail. After several years of continued and increasing business\\nprosperity the positions are just reversed.\\n\\nNo discussion of real-estate mortgages would be complete without\\nallusion to the guaranteed mortgages which have been placed upon the\\nmarket in great quantities within the past few years. Guaranteed\\nmortgages are real-estate mortgages guaranteed as to principal and\\ninterest by substantial companies having large capital and surplus. In\\naddition to the guaranty, the companies usually search and guarantee the\\ntitle, see to it that the taxes, assessments, and insurance are paid,\\nand perform the other services of a real-estate broker. Their\\ncompensation varies somewhat, but probably averages 1/2 per cent--that\\nis, for example, they loan at 5 per cent and sell guaranteed mortgages\\nto the investor at 4-1/2.\\n\\nThe value of the guaranty may be considered from two points of\\nview--first, in the event of a general decline in real-estate values,\\nand, secondly, when a fall occurs in a particular piece of property or\\nin a particular locality.\\n\\nIf a severe decline in real-estate values takes place, affecting all\\nlocalities, it might become necessary for the holders of guaranteed\\nmortgages to test the value of their guaranties. In such a case the\\nquestion would arise how far the capital and surplus of the guaranteeing\\ncompanies would extend in liquidating the mortgages which they had\\nguaranteed. This would depend entirely upon the proportion between the\\ncapital and surplus of the companies and the total amount of outstanding\\nmortgages guaranteed. Ordinarily the capital and surplus do not exceed 5\\nper cent of the mortgages, so that the average guaranty is good for\\nabout 5 per cent additional equity. On a piece of property worth\\n$100,000, upon which a guaranteed mortgage of $60,000 exists, the\\nguaranty would be worth $3,000, and would margin the property down to\\n$57,000. This additional equity is of little value. It is probably\\nunlikely that a 40-per-cent depreciation in value will take place, but\\nthe guaranty is not needed unless it does, and if it should occur, the\\ndepreciation is quite as likely to go to 50 per cent or more as to stop\\nat 43.\\n\\nFrom the second point of view the value of the guaranty is much greater.\\nThe distribution of risk, as in the case of fire-insurance, protects\\nthe holder against loss in the event of a fall in the particular piece\\nof property upon which he holds a mortgage, or even in a particular\\nlocality. It can not be said, however, that the records are yet\\nsufficiently complete to form a conclusion as to what is a safe\\nproportion between capital and surplus and outstanding mortgages.\\nFurther than that the guaranteeing companies, generally speaking, have\\nbeen operating since their inception upon a rising market, so that their\\nsuccess hitherto has not been remarkable. Allowing for these drawbacks,\\nhowever, the private investor, unless so situated as to give personal\\nattention to the details of his investments, will probably do well to\\npurchase his mortgages in guaranteed form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nINDUSTRIAL BONDS\\n\\n\\nIndustrial bonds include the obligations of all manufacturing and\\nmercantile companies, and miscellaneous companies of a private\\ncharacter. They form a class quite distinct from railroad bonds or\\npublic-utility bonds.\\n\\nI. _Safety of Principal and Interest._ The safety of industrial bonds,\\nin common with the safety of all forms of investment, depends upon the\\nmargin of security in excess of the amount of the obligation. In the\\ncase of industrial bonds the amount of this margin is not always easy to\\ndetermine. Even when determined, the rule is difficult of application\\nbecause a margin which may seem insufficient from the point of view of\\nphysical valuation may be satisfactory when considered as the equity of\\na working concern. The indications most to be relied upon in estimating\\nthe safety of industrial bonds are as follows:\\n\\n(_a_) _Value of real estate._ The first point to be determined in\\nconsidering the purchase of an industrial bond is the value of the real\\nestate upon which it is a first mortgage. If the appraised value of the\\nground, irrespective of the buildings and machinery upon it, is greater\\nby a substantial sum than the amount of the bond issue, the obligation\\nis practically a real-estate mortgage. In such a case, while possibly\\n\"slow,\" _i.e._, secured by an assets difficult to realize upon--the\\nsafety of the bond can hardly be questioned. In judging a bond upon its\\nreal-estate value, it is not always safe to take the cost price of the\\nland as shown by the company\\'s books, because frequently the cost upon\\nthe books is artificially raised by payment having been made in\\nsecurities whose market value is less than par, or in other ways. As\\nstated above, judgment should be based upon the _appraised_ value of the\\nland.\\n\\nIf the bond meets this test satisfactorily, the prospective investor may\\nfeel reasonably sure that the safety of his principal is not in\\nquestion, and may buy the bond without anxiety if it satisfies his other\\nrequirements. On the other hand, if the bond only partially meets this\\ntest, and it appears that some part of its value comes from plant and\\nequipment and from the strength of the company as a working concern,\\nthen it is necessary for the investor to consider carefully several\\nother factors.\\n\\n(_b_) _Net quick assets._ The balance-sheet of every industrial company\\ncan be divided horizontally into two parts. Its assets are of two\\nkinds--property assets, which are fixt, and current assets, which are\\nfluid. Similarly, its liabilities are of two kinds--capital liabilities\\nand current liabilities. It requires no very extended business\\nexperience to pick out the items which make up these totals. Plant and\\nproperty assets are usually lumped together under the head, \"Cost of\\nProperty.\" Current assets include inventories, bills and accounts\\nreceivable, agents\\' balances, marketable securities, and cash on hand\\nand in banks--everything, in short, which can be quickly converted into\\ncash. On the other side of the balance-sheet, capital liabilities are\\neasily determined. They consist of the par amounts of bonds and stocks\\noutstanding. Current liabilities comprise bills and accounts payable,\\nincluding borrowed money, pay-rolls, and interest and taxes accrued but\\nnot due.\\n\\nThe real strength of every industrial concern is to be learned from the\\nfigures relating to its current accounts. Property assets and capital\\nliabilities are not of the same significance. If the cost of plant and\\nequipment as shown by the books exceeds its real value, the market\\nusually makes the necessary adjustment by putting a price less than par\\nupon the bonds and stocks.\\n\\nNo such process is possible in the case of the current accounts. If the\\ncurrent liabilities exceed the current assets the company shows a\\ndeficit, whatever its surplus may show on the books. On the other hand,\\nif the current assets are greater than the current liabilities, the\\ncompany possesses a working capital, represented by the difference\\nbetween the two, and known as net quick assets.\\n\\nThere are three things to consider in connection with net quick assets:\\nFirst, the proportion between current assets and current liabilities. To\\nput a company in good shape its current assets should be at least twice\\nas great as its current liabilities. Two for one is a fair proportion,\\ntho some companies show as much as six to one. The stronger a company is\\nin this proportion the better.\\n\\nSecondly, the proportion between net quick assets and bonded debt. The\\nbonded debt should never exceed net quick assets, except when the\\ncompany possesses real estate, in which case two-thirds of the\\nreal-estate value plus the net quick assets should cover the bonds. Some\\ncompanies do much better than that. One prominent company in this\\ncountry, altho it possesses real estate of considerable value, has\\nagreed in the indenture securing its bonds to keep net quick assets at\\nall times greater by a substantial margin than the amount of bonds\\noutstanding.\\n\\nThirdly, the proportion between net quick assets and the surplus as\\nshown in the balance-sheet. If the capital liabilities exactly balance\\nthe property assets, it is plain that the surplus will exactly balance\\nthe net quick assets. If the surplus is smaller than net quick assets,\\nit is usually a sign that capital liabilities have been created to\\nprovide working capital. Opinions differ as to the wisdom of this\\ncourse. Generally speaking, it is better to provide working capital by\\nmeans of a stock issue than to depend upon the banks for accommodation.\\nThe exception to this rule occurs in the case of companies that require\\na great deal of working capital for part of the year and only a little\\nat other times. If they have the best banking connections, such\\ncompanies may be safe in depending upon their banks to carry them, but\\nif they do so, they should have no bonded or other fixt indebtedness\\nwhich would prevent their paper from being a first lien upon their\\nentire assets.\\n\\nIf working capital is to be created by the issue of capital liabilities,\\nit is much better that it should be done by stocks than by bonds. The\\nideal method, however, is to provide only such an amount of working\\ncapital at the organization of a company as is necessary for the conduct\\nof its business, and then, as the volume of its business grows, to\\naccumulate the additional amount necessary out of earnings, refraining\\nfrom the payment of dividends until the fund is complete.\\n\\nBefore leaving the subject of net quick assets, it is well to note the\\nimportance of the figure showing the actual amount of current\\nliabilities. If a company has outstanding large amounts of bills and\\nnotes payable, it occupies a vulnerable position. Inability to renew\\nmaturing notes was the cause of most of the industrial failures of last\\nyear.\\n\\n(_c_) _Net Earnings._ The amount of net earnings is of great importance\\nin estimating the strength of an industrial company. The figures for a\\nnumber of years should be examined to determine whether the earnings are\\nincreasing or decreasing, and to discover whether or not the earning\\npower of the company is stable. This will depend largely upon the nature\\nof the article which the company produces or trades in. If its product\\nenjoys a steady demand at a fairly uniform price, it is justifiable that\\nsome of its capital should be in the form of bonds; but if its earnings\\nare subject to violent fluctations due to rapid changes in the price of\\nits product, there is little justification for conducting the business\\non borrowed money.\\n\\nIn this connection it should always be considered how greatly a falling\\noff in gross earnings will affect net earnings; and the proportion\\nbetween net earnings and fixt charges should be carefully noted.\\n\\nIn order for an industrial bond to receive favorable consideration, the\\naverage yearly net earnings of the company should amount to about three\\ntimes the annual bond interest, taxes, and sinking funds. The greater\\nthe protection is in this respect the better.\\n\\n(_d_) _Form of Issue._ The form in which an industrial bond is issued is\\na matter of some importance. If the principal of the bond does not\\nbecome due for a number of years, there is danger that the property will\\ndepreciate so far in value as to leave the bond without sufficient\\nmargin of protection. There are two ways to overcome this difficulty.\\nOne way is to establish a sinking-fund which will retire a certain\\nproportion of the bonds by lot each year. Another way is to issue the\\nbonds in serial form, with a definite instalment maturing every year. In\\neither case the annual sinking-fund or annual instalment should be\\ngreater than the probable depreciation so that the margin of security\\nwill be constantly increasing.\\n\\n(_e_) _Management and Control._ No question is of greater importance in\\nestimating the strength of an industrial company than the reputation of\\nthe men in charge. The ability and integrity of the men who control the\\npolicy of the company and the efficiency of the operating officials are\\nthe principal factors in the success of an industrial undertaking.\\nVacillating policies, weakly executed, will ruin the most promising\\nenterprise. This is particularly true in the case of small companies.\\nEvery man of business experience will understand the importance of this\\nfactor and be guided by it in the selection of industrial securities.\\n\\nBased upon the foregoing considerations it is of interest to inquire\\nwhat degree of safety really attaches to the average industrial bond?\\nHow far does it meet the foregoing requirements? The question is\\ndifficult to answer. Industrial bonds vary greatly in point of safety,\\nsome issues possessing great strength and others being highly\\nspeculative. No general conclusions can be depended upon, and the\\ninvestor is forced to consider each issue upon its own merits.\\n\\nII. _Rate of Income._ The average net return upon industrial bonds is\\nprobably higher than upon any other form of funded corporate obligation.\\nThis constitutes one of the chief advantages of industrial bonds.\\n\\nIII. _Convertibility._ It is impossible to make any general statement in\\nregard to the convertibility of industrial bonds. Some industrial\\nbonds, notably the larger issues of well-known trusts, command a broad\\nand active market. Such bonds can be sold in large amounts at almost any\\ntime without seriously affecting the price. On the other hand, small\\nunderlying issues of such companies, usually high-grade in point of\\nsecurity, or the obligations of smaller companies, are almost as\\nunmarketable as real-estate mortgages. Between these two extremes all\\nvarieties of industrial bonds are to be found. The degree of\\nconvertibility which a security possesses is usually a matter of some\\nimportance, and the investor should make a careful examination of each\\nbond in this respect.\\n\\nIV. _Prospect of Appreciation in Value._ To what extent a bond may\\nimprove in security during the time that an investor holds it is of\\nlittle importance unless the improvement be reflected in the market\\nprice of the bond. Only so can the investor take advantage of its\\nappreciation in value. In order for the improvement in security to be\\nreflected in market price and thus add to the principal invested, it is\\nnecessary that a bond should possess a fairly active market. For this\\nreason the industrial bonds which hold out the greatest promise of\\nappreciation in value are the larger, more speculative issues, which\\npossess the greatest convertibility. The purchase of such bonds\\nfrequently results in substantial profits.\\n\\nV. _Stability of Market Price._ The four points above touched\\nupon--safety, rate of income, convertibility, and likelihood of\\nimprovement in intrinsic value--are all inherent characteristics of\\nevery bond. The likelihood of favorable or unfavorable fluctation in\\nmarket price is largely external in its nature and depends upon general\\nfinancial and business conditions.\\n\\nAs a class, industrial bonds can not be said to possess much stability\\nof market price. Some of the smaller issues enjoy a fictitious stability\\nbecause of their inactivity, but generally speaking industrial bonds are\\nsubject to wide fluctations in accordance with changes in the business\\noutlook.\\n\\nThe foregoing is a summary, necessarily brief and imperfect, of the main\\npoints to be considered in judging the value of industrial bonds. The\\nquestion remains whether such securities are desirable for the\\ninvestment of a business surplus and of private funds.\\n\\nExcept in special cases industrial bonds are not suitable for a business\\nsurplus. It is impossible to find an industrial bond which combines all\\nthe characteristics necessary for that purpose. The requirements are\\ngreat safety of principal and interest, a relatively high return, ready\\nconvertibility, and stability of market price. Many industrial bonds can\\nbe found which combine two of these requirements, some even which\\ncombine three, but the full combination, if it exists at all, is unknown\\nto the writer.\\n\\nIn addition, the principle of distribution of risk should prevent one\\nindustrial company from investing its reserve funds in the securities of\\nanother industrial company.\\n\\nFor private investment the case is somewhat different. A man of good\\nbusiness judgment, who desires to obtain a high yield for which he is\\nprepared to sacrifice something in the way of convertibility and\\nprospect of appreciation in value, may buy the underlying issues of\\nstrong companies with every confidence in the safety of his principal.\\nAgain, the investor who wants a high yield and quick convertibility, who\\nis prepared to take a business man\\'s risk and to sacrifice stability of\\nmarket price, may make a large profit by buying second-grade industrial\\nbonds. No investor, however, should deceive himself with the idea that\\nany industrial bond will satisfy all the requirements of the ideal\\ninvestment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nPUBLIC-UTILITY BONDS\\n\\n\\nIt was a common saying among bond-dealers a few years ago that the day\\nof the municipal bond had passed, the day of the railroad bond was\\npassing, and the day of the public-utility bond was to be. Municipal\\nbonds were selling at fancy prices in consequence of the low rates for\\nmoney which then prevailed, and railroad bonds appeared to be following\\nin their wake. Public-utility bonds alone afforded a satisfactory yield,\\nand it was felt that the investing public would be forced to turn to\\nthem.\\n\\nThis prediction, like many others which were based upon the assumption\\nof continued ease in money, was destined to be unfulfilled. Almost\\nimmediately there appeared an added demand for capital, and in the face\\nof this demand, supplies of capital which had before seemed ample became\\nsuddenly scarce. Money rates rose rapidly and as a necessary\\nconsequence municipal and railroad bonds fell in price to a point where\\ntheir net return was commensurate with that obtained from the loaning of\\nfree capital. The investment situation was thus completely reversed. It\\nwas no longer a question as to what form of security investors must seek\\nin order to obtain a satisfactory yield, but rather could the highest\\ngrade of municipal and railroad bonds be floated at any price. Under\\nthese circumstances the contemplated necessity of turning to\\npublic-utility bonds never arose, and the general investing public\\nremains for the most part unfamiliar with their elements of strength and\\nof weakness.\\n\\nThe term \"public-utility company\" denotes a private corporation\\nsupplying public needs under authority of a public franchise. The\\nfranchise may be of definite date or perpetual, and may be partial or\\nexclusive.\\n\\nPublic-utility companies include street-railway, gas, electric-light and\\npower, and water companies. Properly speaking, telephone companies\\nshould also be included, but they are not usually regarded as belonging\\nto the class of public-service corporations.\\n\\nIt is impossible, within the limits of a single chapter, to discuss each\\nkind of company separately. The investment value of street-railway bonds\\nwill be here considered, and it is felt that the general principles\\nadvanced, with slight modifications of detail, will be found equally\\napplicable to a judgment of other forms of public-service securities.\\n\\nI. _Safety of Principal and Interest._ In order to determine the safety\\nof a street-railway company\\'s bonds, the company must be subjected to a\\nthreefold examination, physical, financial, and political.\\n\\nAn examination must be made into the extent and condition of the\\nphysical property in order to ascertain whether the bonded debt is\\nsecured by property having a real market value in excess of the face\\namount of bonds issued. The first point to be determined is the extent\\nand valuation of the company\\'s real estate. If the appraised value of\\nthe land upon which power-houses and car-barns have been erected is\\nalone greater than the amount of bonds outstanding, the investigation\\nneed go no further, for the bonds, in such a case, would be practically\\na real-estate mortgage. In most instances, however, this is very far\\nfrom being the case; and after careful appraisal of the real estate it\\nis then necessary to make a careful valuation of the other physical\\nproperty; namely, power-plants, depots, car-sheds, roadway, and\\nequipment.\\n\\nIt is usually impossible for the average investor to make such an\\nexamination himself, nor is it likely that he would possess sufficient\\ntechnical knowledge to render his investigation of much value. For an\\naccurate estimate of the value of a street-railway\\'s physical property,\\nit is usually necessary to depend upon the expert opinion of a trained\\nengineer. It is a matter of regret that the average street-railway\\nreport can not be relied upon to furnish an accurate valuation of the\\nphysical property; and it is accordingly customary for careful\\nbond-dealers, when they contemplate taking an issue of street-railway\\nbonds for distribution among their clients, to have the property\\nexamined by a competent engineer, whose report then determines for them\\nthe question of taking the issue.\\n\\nDisregarding the figures which show the cost of property and equipment\\nupon the company\\'s books, the engineer proceeds to make a careful\\nestimate of the replacement value of the property, including real\\nestate. If the result of the examination shows that the property could\\nnot be duplicated for the amount of the bond issue, the company occupies\\nan unusually strong position--altho even in such a case some part of the\\nvalue of the bonds comes from the strength of the company as a going\\nconcern.\\n\\nIn most cases, however, it is probably found that the bond issue is in\\nexcess of the value of real estate and the replacement value of the\\nphysical property, the balance representing a capitalization of the\\nfranchise.\\n\\nTo determine the real value of the franchise or franchises is a\\ndifficult matter and involves the whole question of the company\\'s\\nrelations with the community which it serves and with the local\\nlawmaking bodies.\\n\\nThe first question which arises is whether the franchise is perpetual or\\nfor a definite time, and the second whether it is partial or exclusive.\\nFranchises vary greatly in these respects. Sometimes a franchise,\\napparently partial, is practically exclusive, owing to the fact that\\nall the available space in the streets is already occupied by the\\ncompany\\'s own tracks. If the franchises of a company are limited as to\\ntime, it is expedient, if not imperative, that the bonds should mature\\nbefore the expiration of the franchises.\\n\\nIf the company whose bonds are under examination satisfactorily passes\\nthis physical test--if it possesses real estate of considerable value,\\nif the replacement value of the property is as great or nearly as great\\nas the amount of the bonds, and if the franchises, while perhaps not\\nperpetual or exclusive, are yet of longer duration than the bonds and\\nrender successful competition unlikely--the next step may then be taken;\\nthat is to say, an examination of the company\\'s financial condition and\\nearning capacity may be made.\\n\\nThe amount of its gross earnings should be examined and the figures\\nscrutinized for a number of years back to discover whether its earnings\\nare increasing or decreasing. The position in which the company stands\\nfor obtaining new traffic must be noted, and some estimate must be made\\nof the stability of its earning power. In this connection the relations\\nof the company to the public are of great importance. It must be learned\\nwhether the company follows the policy of conciliating or ignoring\\npublic sentiment.\\n\\nThe net earnings of the company must then be examined. This involves a\\ncriticism of operating expenses. The payments of the road must be\\nanalyzed to determine whether the proper amounts have been expended for\\nrenewal of track, replenishment of rolling stock, and other improvement\\nsufficient to keep the property in good physical condition. This is the\\nmost intricate subject in the investigation of a street-railway\\nproperty. Unless proper allowance be made for depreciation, in addition\\nto the expenses of direct operation, it is only a question of time\\nbefore the strongest company will become bankrupt.\\n\\nDeterioration of plant and equipment, which goes on constantly, can only\\nbe offset in two ways: one is out of earnings and the other is out of\\nthe security-holders--that is, by decreases in the market value of the\\nsecurities. The first takes prosperity or courage; the second leads to\\nbankruptcy. It is difficult to measure depreciation accurately, but a\\nsafe rule is to write off ten per cent of gross earnings each month for\\ndepreciation. In this way the charge for depreciation will be\\nproportionate to the traffic, which provides automatic adjustment.\\n\\nIf the net earnings, after making this allowance for depreciation, and\\nafter providing all expenses of operation including ordinary repairs,\\namount to as much as twice the interest charges upon the bonds\\noutstanding, it is probable that the bonds may be taken with safety.\\n\\nBefore finally determining the question, however, certain political\\nfactors must be taken into consideration. The relations of the company\\nto the leaders of the dominant political party must be investigated. The\\nlikelihood of agitation looking toward a reduction of fares must be\\nconsidered and the possibility of increase in taxes (if below the legal\\nlimit) must be weighed. The probable attitude of the legislature on the\\nquestion of renewing the franchises when they expire must be considered.\\nIn general, it must be learned whether any real ground of contention\\nexists between the company on the one hand and the public and its\\nrepresentatives on the other, because it is inevitable that the company\\nwill weaken its independence of position by too close a connection with\\npolitics, and that the physical property will suffer if there is any\\nlack of uninterrupted attention to it.\\n\\nFinally one other thing should be investigated--the amount of the\\naccident account and its proportion to the net earnings of the company.\\nOn small lines a single case of heavy damages will sometimes make\\nserious inroads upon the earnings.\\n\\nThe foregoing is a summary, necessarily brief and imperfect, but true in\\nits essential outlines, of the main points which should be considered in\\njudging the safety of street-railway bonds. The question remains, how\\nfar does the average street-railway company satisfy these requirements?\\nBroadly speaking, street-railway bonds are not yet to be classed in the\\nfirst rank of investment securities. The troubles which have come to a\\nhead in the financial operations of the traction systems in New York and\\nChicago are typical of troubles which are likely to occur elsewhere from\\nthe same general causes--overcapitalization in the first place and\\ninsufficient allowance for depreciation in the second place. In both New\\nYork and Chicago the crisis was hastened by open and obvious\\novercapitalization, which is almost inevitable when many independent\\nlines are merged into one system. The same trouble, however, is apt to\\noccur in other traction systems where this evil appeared less flagrant\\nat the outset.\\n\\nThe advantages of electricity over horsepower naturally led to the\\nmultiplication of electric street lines, as the system ten or fifteen\\nyears ago passed beyond the experimental stage. As in all new\\nenterprises, speculation ran ahead of the reality and financing built\\nupon oversanguine calculations has too often had difficulty in squaring\\naccounts when brought face to face with facts. In most of the\\ncalculations insufficient allowance was made for the wear and tear of\\nservice; in other words, for renewal of road and equipment. After a few\\nyears\\' test of earnings against expenses, it became evident that a\\nproper allowance for depreciation of plant would show a heavy deficit in\\nthe income account. In most cases therefore no allowance or only a\\nmeager one was made. For a time this method of bookkeeping proved less\\ndisastrous than might have been expected owing to the rapid growth of\\npopulation and business in American cities. It was possible in many\\ncases to consider the enhanced value given to the franchise by growth of\\nbusiness as an offset to the depreciation of tracks and equipment. In so\\nfar also as the plant was kept up to a high degree of efficiency by\\ncharging the expense of repairs to operating expenses, the absence of a\\ndepreciation account was partially offset.\\n\\nWith the progress of recent years, however, a new factor has been\\nentering into the problem which promises to make the situation still\\nmore serious for the traction systems. This new factor is the rise in\\nprices and wages. Temporarily the influence of this factor may be\\nchecked by diminished business activity, but when normal conditions are\\nrestored, it will commence to act again upon the railways with\\naccumulated effect.\\n\\nIn most cases a proposition to increase the standard street-railway fare\\nabove five cents as an offset to the increased operating expenses would\\nbe so revolutionary a proposal that it could hardly be carried through.\\nWith the line of cost converging upon the line of receipts and with no\\nproper allowance made for depreciation, the traction systems of the\\ncountry seem to be facing a difficult problem. In the long run it can\\nnot be doubted that the problem will be met and solved in a way to\\nafford justice alike to the public who use the cars and to the\\ncapitalists who have made street traction on a large scale possible, but\\nin the meantime the investor who desires perfect safety should exercise\\ngreat care and discrimination in his purchases of street-railway\\nobligations.\\n\\nII. _Rate of Income._ As a general rule, street-railway bonds in common\\nwith the obligations of all public-service corporations sell upon about\\nthe same income basis as high-grade industrial bonds--that is to say,\\nunder normal conditions they return considerably more than railroad or\\nmunicipal bonds.\\n\\nIII. _Convertibility._ It is difficult to speak of the convertibility of\\npublic-utility bonds as a class for the reason that they differ widely\\nfrom one another in this respect. In general, it is certainly more\\ndifficult to dispose of public-utility bonds than railroad bonds. They\\ndo not possess sufficient convertibility to justify their purchase by\\nany one who may need to realize quickly on his holdings.\\n\\nIV. _Prospect of Appreciation in Value._ Public-utility bonds, except\\nsuch issues as are convertible into stock, possess little prospect of\\nappreciation in value. It was pointed out above that depreciation is not\\nproperly allowed for, and it is very difficult for the securities to\\nadvance in the face of this obstacle.\\n\\nV. _Stability of Market Price._ The bonds of public-service corporations\\nare relatively more stable than railroad bonds because their earnings\\nare not subject to the fluctations which occur in railroad properties\\nbetween years of prosperity and years of depression. At the same time,\\nit should be pointed out that their stability of price is largely\\nfictitious, owing to the comparative inactivity of the issues. In other\\nwords, while the quotation may be maintained, it is usually difficult to\\nsell any large quantity of a public-service corporation\\'s bonds in a\\nperiod of financial disturbance, while railroad bonds are more easily\\nliquidated even if at a sacrifice.\\n\\nThe question remains, do public-utility bonds afford a desirable\\nsecurity for the investment of a business surplus and of private funds?\\nIn regard to the former, it may be said at once that public-utility\\nbonds do not meet the necessary conditions. The security is too\\ndoubtful, the convertibility is too small, and the stability of price\\ntoo uncertain.\\n\\nFor private investment the case is somewhat different. Keeping in mind\\nthe desirability of diversifying investments and admitting the\\nattractiveness of investing in a class of property whose earnings are\\ncomparatively stable, it seems clear that public-utility bonds can not\\nbe dismissed without consideration. When a company is found whose\\nproperty is substantially equal in real value to its bonded debt, whose\\nallowance for depreciation is ample, whose franchises are satisfactory,\\nwhose earning capacity is large, and whose management is capable and\\nupright, the investor is justified in giving careful consideration to\\nits issues. Unless all these points are found to be satisfactory,\\nhowever, the investor should content himself with some other form of\\nsecurity. For some years to come it is to be feared that many of our\\npublic-service corporations will suffer from the war of discordant\\nelements--disregard of the rights of the public on the part of the\\nmanagement and socialistic agitation for control on the part of the\\ncommunity. Until these warring factions are reconciled and the questions\\nat issue adjusted with fairness to the security-holders and the public,\\nthe investor should be most prudent in his purchases of public-utility\\nobligations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nMUNICIPAL BONDS\\n\\n\\nThe previous chapters have considered, in turn, the investment value of\\nrailroad bonds, real-estate mortgages, industrial bonds, and\\npublic-utility bonds. The desirability of each of these different\\nclasses of security has been judged in accordance with the general\\nprinciples laid down in the introductory chapter; that is to say, each\\nclass has been analyzed in relation to safety, rate of income,\\nconvertibility, prospect of appreciation in value and stability of\\nmarket price. The same determining factors must now be applied to a\\njudgment of government, State, and municipal bonds.\\n\\nBonds issued by a national government, by a State, or by a municipality\\nare based primarily on some form of the power of taxation, tho the bonds\\nare usually tax exempt within the political unit which creates them.\\n\\nWhen the power of taxation is unlimited, as in the case of the national\\ngovernment and the sovereign States, there can be no question as to the\\nability of the political unit to meet its obligation, and the question\\nbecomes entirely one of good faith. It is probable that the obligations\\nof the United States Government, by reason of the fact that the\\nper-capita debt of the country is so small, the wealth of the country so\\ngreat, and the good faith of the American people so clearly established,\\nrepresent the highest type of security to be found in the world. It is\\nquite possible, therefore, that the 2-per-cent United States Consols\\nwould sell in any case at a relatively higher price than the obligations\\nof any other country, but it can not be denied that the chief reason\\nwhich causes them to sell at the remarkably high price which they have\\nattained is the fact that they are required by national banks as\\nsecurity for circulation. This fact is doubtless the controlling element\\nin their market position, and at once accounts for their special\\nstrength and removes them from the field of private investment.\\n\\nOnly less secure than United States bonds are the obligations of the\\nsovereign States of the Union. State bonds usually sell upon a basis\\nwhich may be taken as the equivalent of pure interest, with no element\\nof risk or speculation involved. The obligations of different States\\nsell at different prices, in accordance with market conditions and the\\nrelations of supply and demand, but there can be no question of the\\nequal ability of all States to pay their obligations. Repudiation of\\nState debts has occurred in our history, but only in cases where an\\noverwhelming majority of the citizens were opposed to the creation of\\nthe debt at the time of its issue, but lacked the means to control the\\nsituation. Such instances are chiefly to be found in the case of the\\nso-called carpet-bag governments of the Southern States after the Civil\\nWar.\\n\\nMunicipal bonds--_i.e._, the bonds of cities, counties, and\\ntownships--are indirectly a first lien upon all taxable property in the\\nmunicipality, and take precedence of every form of mortgage or judgment\\nlien. This lien is enforced through a tax levy to meet interest and\\nprincipal, and this tax levy the courts will compel in the rare cases in\\nwhich a municipality attempts to repudiate a valid bond. This priority\\nof the tax lien is the foundation of the prime position of municipal\\nbonds. The case rarely occurs where a bond held valid by the courts\\nproves uncollectable if sufficient taxing power existed when the bond\\nwas issued to provide for its redemption. It is only when the\\nmunicipality itself diminishes in population and taxable property to the\\nvanishing-point that such a default can occur. An investor can judge for\\nhimself as to the likelihood of such a catastrophe in any particular\\ncommunity, and can feel sure that his bond, if valid and protected by a\\nsufficient taxing power, is as secure in its principal and interest as\\nthe municipality which issues it is secure in its continued existence.\\nThe following are the chief points which should be considered in the\\ninvestigation of a municipal bond: (1) The proportion which the total\\ndebt of the municipality bears to the assessed valuation of the property\\nsubject to taxation. Usually a maximum rate is fixt by constitutional\\nprovision which rarely exceeds 10 per cent. (2) The purpose of issue.\\nThis must be a proper and suitable one. (3) The proceedings under which\\nthe bonds were issued. These proceedings, the form of bonds, their\\nexecution, and their legal details must be in full compliance with the\\nlaw.\\n\\nIf these points are found to be satisfactory, the investor may rest\\ncontent that no other form of security is so greatly safeguarded and\\nthat his bond ranks upon a substantial equality with government and\\nState obligations.\\n\\nThe rate of income to be derived from investment in municipal bonds\\nvaries in accordance with the obligations selected. Like other forms of\\nsecurity, municipal bonds are controlled by market conditions, and their\\nprice is determined by the relations of supply and demand, and by\\nadjustment to prevailing money rates. While differing only moderately\\nfrom one another in point of safety and income return, municipal bonds\\nmay be divided into two distinct classes in accordance with the degree\\nof convertibility which they possess. Some municipal bonds possess great\\nconvertibility; others almost none. The feature which chiefly determines\\nthe activity or inactivity of a municipal issue is the size and\\nimportance of the municipality, together with the amount of bonds which\\nit has outstanding. The bonds of large and important cities, whose\\noutstanding debt reaches considerable proportions, usually possess great\\nactivity. They are constantly traded in and command a broad market\\nbecause dealers are willing to buy or sell them in blocks at prices\\nwithin a fraction of 1 per cent apart.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the bonds of counties, townships, and small cities\\nare usually quite inactive. Transactions rarely occur in them, dealers\\ndo not make a market in them, and they can be sold only to genuine\\ninvestors. It is often impossible to have them even quoted.\\n\\nAt first sight, it would appear that active municipal bonds would be\\nmuch more desirable, but inactive municipals possess a special advantage\\nwhich the active ones do not enjoy. They possess more stability of\\nmarket price. It is true that their stability of value is due to the\\nfact that they are not traded in or quoted and is, therefore, largely\\nfictitious, but nevertheless it accomplished a useful purpose. It\\nenables the investor to carry inactive municipals at cost price upon\\nhis books through periods in which active market bonds would require\\nto be marked down in conformity with prevailing market prices. No\\nother class of investment except real-estate mortgages possesses to\\nthe same degree this quality of price stability. For many classes of\\nbuyers--savings-banks, for example--stability of price is a consideration\\nof prime importance. The preservation of the savings-bank\\'s surplus and,\\nindeed, the continued solvency of the institution depend upon maintaining\\nthe integrity of the principal which it has invested. A savings-bank\\nrequires, also, great safety of principal and interest; _i.e._, the\\ncertainty that principal and interest instalments will be paid at\\nmaturity. It needs only a fair but not high yield, and it does not need\\nto place emphasis upon convertibility or prospect of appreciation in\\nvalue. Comparison of these requirements with the characteristics of\\ninactive municipal bonds discloses a striking adaptability on their\\npart to the real needs of the case. As a consequence, it is not\\nsurprizing to discover that inactive municipals are greatly sought\\nby savings-banks.\\n\\nThe desirability of inactive municipals for savings-bank investment was\\nnever more forcibly illustrated than on the first of last January, when\\nthe savings-banks came to make up their annual statements. Broadly\\nspeaking, there can be no doubt that they were saved by the large\\nquantity of inactive municipals and real-estate mortgages which they\\ncarried. Had any considerable portion of their assets consisted of\\nrailroad bonds and active municipals, upon which they should have had to\\nwrite off a loss of ten to fifteen points, their solvency would almost\\ncertainly have been impaired.\\n\\nBut we are chiefly concerned in these pages with the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of different forms of investment from the point of view of\\na business man, both for the investment of his business surplus and of\\nhis private funds. Do municipal bonds, either active or inactive,\\nconform to the requirements of the business surplus? It can not be said\\nthat they do. Municipal bonds possess either convertibility without\\nstability of price or stability of price without convertibility. Both\\nqualities are necessary for a business surplus. The only form of\\nmunicipal security which is at all adapted for the investment of a\\nbusiness surplus is a short-term issue of an active municipal bond. If\\nit has only a very few years to run, its constant approach to maturity\\nwill invest it with the necessary stability of price. But even in this\\ncase equal safety and equal stability of price combined with a higher\\nyield can probably be found in some high-grade railroad issue--either a\\nshort-term mortgage or equipment bond.\\n\\nFor private investment the case is somewhat different. Enough has been\\nsaid in the preceding chapters to impress upon the reader the importance\\nof buying securities only in accordance with his real requirements. If\\nany investor, after careful comparison of the characteristics of\\nmunicipal bonds, either active or inactive, with his necessities,\\ndecides that he can more closely satisfy his requirements with\\nmunicipals than with any other form of security, he should not hesitate\\nto purchase them. It is the opinion of the writer, however, that a\\nthorough survey of the field of investment will generally disclose to\\nthe investor some security in either the railroad or corporation field\\nwhich will suit his requirements as well as the municipal bond and at\\nthe same time provide him with a greater income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nSTOCKS\\n\\n\\nPassing to the consideration of stocks as investments, it is necessary\\nat the outset that the reader should have clearly in mind the\\nfundamental difference between stocks and bonds. This distinction was\\ndrawn in the introductory chapter, but it will be well to amplify it\\nhere, even at the risk of carrying the reader over familiar ground.\\n\\nThe distinction between bonds and stocks is that between _promises to\\npay_ and _equities_. Bonds, loans on collateral, and real-estate\\nmortgages represent some one\\'s promise to pay a sum of money at a future\\ndate; and if the promise be valid and the security ample, the holder of\\nthe promise will be paid the money on the date due. Stocks, on the other\\nhand, represent only a beneficial interest or residuary share in the\\nassets and profits of a working concern after payment of its obligations\\nand fixt charges. The value of the residuary share may be large or\\nsmall, may increase or diminish, but in no case can the holder of such a\\nshare require any one, least of all the company itself, to take his\\nshare off his hands at the price he paid for it, or, indeed, at any\\nprice. If a man buys a $1,000 railroad bond, he knows that the railroad,\\nif solvent, will pay him $1,000 in cash when the bond matures, but if he\\nbuys a share of railroad stock his only chance of getting his money\\nback, if he should wish it, is that some one else will want to buy his\\nshare from him at the price he paid for it or more. If he buys a bond he\\nbecomes a creditor of the company, without voice in its management, but\\nentitled to receive his principal and interest when due under pain of\\nforfeiture of the security which the company made over to the trustee to\\ninsure payment. If he buys stock, he becomes a partner in a business\\nenterprise, exercising his proportionate share in the direction of the\\ncompany\\'s affairs, and sharing ratably in its profits and losses. In the\\none case he buys a promise to pay and in the other an equity.\\n\\nThis distinction, which appears plainly marked in theory, has been\\nmuch obscured in recent years by the influence of two factors. As the\\ncountry grew in size, the large corporations--the railroads, for\\nexample--required greater capital in order to provide facilities for the\\nhandling of their growing business. It was impossible to provide this\\ncapital wholly by means of bond issues without destroying the proportion\\nbetween bonds and stocks, which alone could give to the bondholders the\\nprotection of a substantial equity. It was therefore necessary to obtain\\na large part of the capital required in the form of stock. The\\nrailway-managers were thus confronted with a difficult problem. It was\\nimperative that they should obtain more capital, and it was impossible\\nto dispose of sufficient stock on the basis of a speculative risk in a\\nbusiness venture. It was therefore necessary for the railway-managers to\\nemphasize, as far as possible, the investment character of their stock,\\nand various expedients were adopted to accomplish this purpose. In some\\ncases preferred stocks were created or resulted from reorganizations,\\nwhich possest a first lien upon the assets after payment of the\\nobligations, and which were entitled to a certain stipulated dividend\\nbefore the common stock obtained any distribution from the earnings. In\\nthis way the railway-managers created a compromise security which could\\nbe regarded as a stock, and would thus provide equity from the\\nbondholders\\' point of view, and, at the same time, one which could be\\ndisposed of to investors. In other cases, which were probably more\\nnumerous, railway-managers attempted to give their stock an investment\\nvalue through stability of income return. In good years when the company\\nearned 10 or 15 per cent on its stock, their policy was to pay only 5 or\\n6 per cent in dividends, and hold the rest in their surplus fund in\\norder to have the means of paying the same dividends the next year if\\nonly 2 or 3 per cent should be earned. By giving their stock stability\\nof income return they hoped and expected to give it some stability of\\nmarket price, and thus make it attractive to genuine investors. The\\neffect of this policy was unquestionably successful, and one after\\nanother the stocks of our more important transportation systems and\\nother large undertakings passed into the hands of investors.\\n\\nThe successful adoption of this policy on the part of the\\nrailway-managers and other captains of industry has had one curious\\neffect which was not contemplated by the originators of the movement,\\nand which brings us to the second influence mentioned above as having\\ntended to obscure the distinction between bonds and stocks. When a case\\nhas been brought before the courts in which the contention was advanced\\nthat the charges of the railway or public-service corporation were too\\nhigh, the courts appear to have taken the ground that stocks and bonds\\nshould be classed together in order to determine the aggregate\\ncapitalization of the company, and that the justice or injustice of the\\ncontention that the charges are too high should be determined by\\nascertaining whether if the charges were made lower the net earnings\\nwould still be sufficient to pay a fair return on the total capital\\ninvested. This is the general line of reasoning pursued by the courts,\\nboth in the case of the Consolidated Gas Company in New York and the\\nPennsylvania Railroad in Pennsylvania. The effect of this attitude on\\nthe part of the courts has been to obscure still more greatly the real\\ndistinction between bonds and stocks. It is too early as yet to judge\\nwhat will be the final outcome of the changed attitude toward stocks,\\nbut it can not be doubted that the present tendency of opinion on the\\nsubject, so far as large corporations are concerned, is to limit the\\nreturn on stocks to a strictly investment basis, instead of leaving the\\nstockholders free to reap all possible profit from their business\\nventure subject to the restraints of competition.\\n\\nThe adoption of this attitude by the courts should be a matter for\\nserious consideration on the part of present and prospective\\nstockholders. If the maximum return on stock is to be limited to 6 per\\ncent, or any fair investment basis, and charges reduced to consumers so\\nthat they obtain the benefit of any greater earning power, it would\\nappear that the stockholders occupy an undesirable position. With their\\npossible profits limited, but with no fixt return insured to them and no\\nguaranty against possible loss, it can not be held that the purchase of\\nstock seems attractive.\\n\\nThese questions, however, will doubtless be settled in the long run in\\njustice both to the public and to the stockholders, and in the meantime\\nthe stocks of our large and successful railway and industrial\\ncorporations, which have attained a certain stability and permanence of\\nvalue, are entitled to consideration when investments are contemplated.\\nIt is not worth while to lay down rules for judging the investment value\\nof such stocks, because the general principles advanced in the preceding\\nchapters will be found sufficient for a judgment of their values.\\n\\nOne class of stocks, however, deserves special mention. Bank and\\ntrust-company stocks possess one characteristic in higher degree than\\nother classes of stock. Owing to the general practise of self-regulated\\nbanking institutions to distribute only about one-half their earnings in\\ndividends and to credit the rest to surplus account, a steady rise is\\nassured in the book value of the stock. No other class of stock\\npossesses quite the same promise of appreciation in value. Bank and\\ntrust-company stocks are especially sought by wealthy men, who can\\nforego something in the way of income return for the sake of increasing\\nthe amount of their principal. The general characteristics of bank\\nstocks are great safety, a low rate of income, limited convertibility,\\nand practical certainty of appreciation in value.\\n\\nWith the present chapter the discussion of specific forms of investments\\nhas come to an end. The next and concluding chapter will explain the\\ngeneral principles which control the market movements of all negotiable\\nsecurities, and will endeavor to point out the indications which may be\\nrelied upon in determining whether or not given conditions are favorable\\nfor the purchase of securities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nMARKET MOVEMENTS OF SECURITIES\\n\\n\\nThere is no question connected with the investment of money more\\nimportant than the ability to judge whether general market conditions\\nare favorable for the purchase of securities.\\n\\nAfter learning how to judge the value of every form of investment, a man\\nmay still be unsuccessful in the investment of money unless he acquires\\nalso a firm grasp upon the general principles which control the price\\nmovements of securities. By this it is not meant that a man needs to\\nhave an intimate knowledge of technical market conditions whereby to\\nestimate temporary fluctations of minor importance, but rather that he\\nshould have clearly in mind the causes which operate to produce the\\nlarger swings of prices. If an investor acquires such a knowledge, he is\\nenabled to take advantage of large price movements in such a way as\\nmaterially to increase his income, and, at the same time, avoid\\ncarrying upon his books securities which may have cost much more than\\ntheir current market quotations. If he can recognize the indications\\nwhich point to the beginning of a pronounced upward swing in securities,\\nand if he can equally recognize the signs which indicate that the\\nmovement has culminated, he can liquidate the securities which he bought\\nat the inception of the rise or transfer them to some short-term issues\\nwhose near approach to maturity will render them stable in price,\\nallowing the downward swing to proceed without disturbing him. It is not\\nexpected, of course, that the average business man will be able to\\nrealize completely this ideal of investment, but it is hoped that the\\nfollowing analysis will give him a clearer conception of the principles\\ninvolved.\\n\\nBroadly speaking, the market movements of all negotiable securities are\\ncontrolled by two influences, sometimes acting in opposition to each\\nother and sometimes in concert. One of these influences is the loaning\\nrate of free capital; the other is the general condition of business. A\\nlow rate of interest or the likelihood of low rates has the effect of\\nstimulating security prices, because banks and other money-lending\\ninstitutions are forced into the investment market when they can not\\nloan money to advantage. Conversely, a high rate of interest or the\\nprospect of high rates has the effect of depressing prices, because\\nbanking institutions sell their securities in order to lend the money so\\nreleased. The automatic working of this process tends to produce a\\nconstant adjustment between the yields upon free and invested capital.\\nWhen money rates are low, securities tend to advance to the point where\\nthe return upon them is no greater than that derived from the loaning of\\nfree capital. When rates are high, securities tend to decline to a point\\nwhere the return is as great. This explains the influence of the first\\nfactor.\\n\\nThe other factor is the general condition of business. Good business\\nconditions, or the promise of good conditions, tend to advance security\\nprices, because they indicate larger earnings and a stronger financial\\ncondition. Poor business conditions, or an unpromising outlook, have the\\nreverse effect.\\n\\nThe larger movements of security prices are always the resultant of the\\ninteraction of these two forces. When they work together the effect is\\nirresistible, as when low interest rates and the prospect of good\\nbusiness conditions occur together, or when high money rates occur in\\nthe face of an indicated falling off in business activity. At such times\\nall classes of securities swing together. For the most part, however,\\nmoney rates and business conditions are opposed in their influence,\\nrates being low when business is bad and high when business is good.\\nUsually the worse business conditions become, the easier money grows;\\nwhile the more active business becomes, the higher money rates rise. The\\neffect of this antagonism between the controlling causes is to produce\\nmovements of different proportions and sometimes in different directions\\nin different classes of securities. High-grade bonds may be declining,\\nmiddle-grade bonds remaining stationary, and poor bonds advancing, all\\nat the same time. This serves to give a very irregular appearance to the\\nsecurity markets, and appears to justify the widely held opinion that\\nsecurity prices are a pure matter of guesswork, and that they are\\ncontrolled only by manipulation and special influences. A clear\\nconception of the nature of the influences which are always silently at\\nwork reconciles these apparent inconsistencies and makes it plain that\\ngeneral price movements are determined by laws as certain in their\\noperation as the laws of nature.\\n\\nThis may be illustrated by a single example. Let us assume that interest\\nrates are low and business conditions bad with prospect of still lower\\ninterest rates and still more unpromising business conditions. What will\\nbe the effect upon different classes of securities? High-grade bonds,\\nsuch as choice municipals, whose safety can not be impaired by any\\nextent of depression in business, will advance because their market\\nprice is influenced almost wholly by money rates. If their interest is\\ncertain to be paid, no matter what business conditions may become, they\\ncan not be greatly affected by a reduction of earnings, and consequently\\nthe influence of low money rates is left to act practically alone.\\nMiddle-grade bonds, such as second-class railroad issues, will remain\\nalmost stationary, low money rates tending to advance their price and\\nthe fear of decreased earnings tending to depress them. The lowest grade\\nof bonds and stocks, whose margin of security even in good times is not\\nvery great, will probably suffer in price because the fear of default in\\ninterest and of reduction in dividends will operate much more strongly\\nthan the mere stimulus of low interest rates. Of course, securities can\\nnot be clearly separated into these three classes, but shade\\nimperceptibly into one another. The classification is adopted only for\\npurposes of illustration.\\n\\nUp to this point we have been concerned merely in showing that the\\nmarket movements of negotiable securities are controlled by the\\ninfluence of certain factors. A more important question now remains to\\nbe considered, viz.: whether the effect of these two influences is to\\nproduce general swings in prices which may be depended upon with\\ncomparative certainty, and, if so, what indications are afforded to the\\ninvestor of the commencement or culmination of such a movement. The\\nanswer must be that the combined effect of the two influences described\\nis to produce definite and regular swings in prices, and that the\\nindications which define the movements are not difficult to follow.\\n\\nA general survey of the history of every industrial nation reveals the\\nfact that business conditions undergo alternate periods of prosperity\\nand depression extending in clearly defined cycles of substantially\\nuniform length. By tracing the usual course of interest rates and of\\nbusiness conditions throughout one of these cycles, a general idea can\\nbe formed of the way in which the joint influences operate to produce\\nprice movements. To what extent the course of interest rates is a cause\\nas well as a result of changing business conditions, we shall not\\nattempt here to estimate, but will be content to note carefully the\\ngeneral course which rates for money pursue throughout the cycles.\\nImmediately after a financial crisis, which usually closes an era of\\ngreat business prosperity, money rates become abnormally easy. Within a\\nfew months from the climax of the crisis, money accumulates in enormous\\nvolume in financial centers. This is caused by the great diminution of\\nbusiness activity which renders unnecessary a large part of the\\ncirculating medium that was formerly required to transact the greater\\nvolume of business. To the extent to which this accumulation of money\\nmerely reflects a redundancy of currency as distinguished from real\\nliquid capital, it can have little effect in encouraging the resumption\\nof business activity. As time passes, however, and economies in\\noperation commence to make themselves manifest, and especially as waste\\nand extravagance are curtailed, the country as a whole commences to\\naccumulate real liquid capital; that is to say, its total production\\nleaves a surplus over the amount of consumption. In the state of\\nbusiness feeling which has been pictured, the undertaking of new\\nbusiness ventures or additions to existing properties would not be\\napproved, so that the surplus wealth created finds its way into bank\\ndeposits as liquid capital. The competitive attempt to loan this capital\\nat a time when borrowers are few produces merely nominal interest rates.\\nThis continues for some time. It is only gradually as confidence returns\\nand as the spirit of initiative begins to reassert itself that some part\\nof the liquid capital created each year is diverted into fixt forms.\\nHere and there some enterprising group of men will develop a mine, lay a\\nnew piece of railway, or make some addition to an existing undertaking.\\nFor some length of time, however, the liquid capital of the country not\\nonly remains unimpaired, but is continually increasing. After a time a\\nchange comes. The annual surplus of production, tho larger than before,\\nis only sufficient to provide for the new undertakings which the growing\\noptimism demands. Interest rates rise moderately in response to the\\nadded demand for capital. A few years further along, as business\\nactivity increases and success appears plainly to wait upon new\\nventures, the demand for new capital with which to develop increased\\nfacilities and new enterprises exceeds the annual supply of wealth\\ncreated. Prosperity having increased, another factor commences to assert\\nitself. The spirit of economy and thrift which had prevailed throughout\\nthe years of depression gives place to extravagance, the demand for\\nluxuries, and other unproductive forms of expenditure. While the total\\nproduction is much greater than in the lean years, the margin of\\nproduction is not proportionately as great, and this amount is\\ninsufficient to meet the demands upon it. The supplies of liquid capital\\nstored up during the years of depression are resorted to, and they serve\\nto provide the new capital for a few additional years. Interest rates at\\nonce reflect the encroachment upon stored-up capital, and their rise\\ngives the first real warning of the country\\'s true position. The\\noptimistic business men do not heed the warning. After exhausting all\\nthe real capital available in the country, they proceed to borrow\\nextensively from foreigners or from government banks--in this country\\nfrom the national government through bank deposits. Every step which can\\nbe taken to induce foreigners to part with their capital is resorted to.\\nIf foreigners will not buy long-term bonds, short-term notes are\\ncreated. If the foreigners refuse these, they are asked to make loans\\nsecured by the new bonds and notes. The rates of interest offered are so\\nattractive that considerable sums are usually obtained, and the pressure\\nof business activity continues further. Finally the day of reckoning\\narrives when some incident, usually unimportant in itself, first\\nsuggests to the lenders of money that their debtors whom they know to be\\noverextended may not be able to pay their loans. The attempt to collect\\ntheir loans produces a financial crisis which brings to an end the\\nperiod of prosperity.\\n\\nThe foregoing is a description of the more important stages through\\nwhich business conditions pass from crisis to crisis. Different cycles\\nvary in particular details, but all agree in essential outlines.\\nSometimes special influences are at work which operate to shorten or\\nprolong the cycle. The approach of a crisis will be retarded by\\ninflation of the currency, for the excess finds its way into bank vaults\\nand increases the volume of loanable credit. The effect of such\\ninflation, however, is wholly disastrous, because the addition to the\\nsupply of capital is fictitious, not real, and only defers the day of\\nreckoning for a greater catastrophe. On the other hand, the approach of\\na crisis can be greatly hastened by wars, conflagrations, and other\\nagencies which destroy capital, and by attacks upon capital and the\\nconduct of corporate business, for such attacks tend to render capital\\ntimid and produce the same effect as a violent curtailment of the\\nsupply. These are only some of the many influences which might become\\noperative, but they serve to show the necessity for careful\\nconsideration of all the factors at work if a true conception of the\\ncondition and tendencies of business is to be formed.\\n\\nFrom the general account given above of the successive phases of a\\ncredit cycle, it is possible to summarize the course of interest rates\\nand the course of business conditions. Money rates become suddenly easy\\nafter a crisis, remain low or grow easier for a period of several years,\\nand then rise continuously until the next crisis, advancing with great\\nrapidity toward the close of the cycle. Business conditions remain poor\\nor grow worse a few years after a crisis. Liquidation is taking place,\\nprices are going down, and the uncertainty of the outlook causes\\ndiminished activity. Thereafter, however, conditions improve and\\nactivity increases with fair uniformity until it reaches the high\\ntension of the period immediately preceding the crisis. The course of\\ninterest rates and the course of business conditions may both be\\ndeflected by the operation of special influences, but the general\\ntendencies are substantially as outlined. The result of the operation of\\nthese joint factors may be traced in the market movements of any class\\nof security desired. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider their\\neffect in producing the market swings of the highest grade of investment\\nissues and of the lowest grade, those which are affected only by money\\nrates and those which are affected almost wholly by business\\nconditions.\\n\\nEmerging from the strain of the crisis at their lowest point, high-grade\\nbonds, such as the best municipal and railroad issues, advance rapidly\\nas interest rates decline, continuing their advancing tendency\\nthroughout the period of business depression which follows upon the\\nheels of the crisis. As business conditions improve, their position,\\nwhile perfectly secure before, is further strengthened and an added\\nstimulus is given to their rise. About the middle of the cycle when the\\nbusiness outlook is very promising, and before interest rates have\\nsustained any material advance, the prices of high-grade bonds are\\nusually at their highest point. From that time forward they commence to\\ndecline, in spite of the increasing prosperity of the country, under the\\ninfluence of rising money rates. They make their lowest prices in the\\nmidst of the crisis, when the strain upon capital is greatest and the\\noutlook for business most unpromising.\\n\\nThe lowest grade of bonds, on the other hand (whose margin of security\\nis least), do not commence to recover materially in price, in spite of\\nthe influence of low money rates during the hard times which follow the\\ncrisis, the influence of reduced earnings and the fear of default of\\ninterest holding them in check. As the outlook becomes brighter, they\\nadvance rapidly and continue to improve in price so long as they yield\\nmore than current money rates. At some point, difficult to determine in\\nadvance but usually well along toward the end of the cycle, they reach\\ntheir high point and thereafter decline under the influence of the\\ngrowing stringency in money.\\n\\nBetween these two extremes, every class of security is to be found. The\\nbetter ones will tend to resemble, in their market movements, the course\\npursued by the choicest bonds; the poorer ones will approximate the\\nlowest class. In every case, however, unless special influences operate\\nto produce variations, the market swing of a given security should be\\neasily conjectured by an investor who gives careful attention to the\\nrelative weight which is likely to attach to each determining influence.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note: Spelling remains as in the original except\\n\"qualities to be emphasied; for investors\" has been changed to\\n\"emphasized\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s How to Invest Money, by George Garr Henry\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOW TO INVEST MONEY ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.
